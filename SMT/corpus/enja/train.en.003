he showed us his mother 's picture .
i 'm feeling much better today .
we agreed to her suggestions .

i spoke after him .
we are not short of oil in this country .

we all wished for peace .
send me the account .

i 'm home , mom !
we were all present at the meeting .
she fell on her face .
do you know who he is ?
it is no wonder that he has succeeded .
it took me five hours to finish the work .
which way did you choose ?
eating too much is bad for the health .
sometimes reading took up half his time .
i talked with him about it over the telephone .
he was amazed at the sight .
she stood by him .
your book is on the desk .
i got to get out of here .
he can swim faster than any other boy in his class .

this room will soon heat up .
i don 't know what to do .

it is no wonder that he has failed .
i have never gone to america .
i am friends with her .
anyhow , don 't make me one .
he is anything but a scholar .
my house was broken into last night .
he is always on the move .
i don 't know the day when he will come .
my car needs repairing .
i am not content with what i am .
he was absorbed in the book .
good luck to you !
my brother and i shared the room .
this is a book about stars .
i 'm not a bit interested in chemistry .
he left everything to chance .
he ran off to meet his teacher .
should i fail , i would try again .

he is in charge of our class .
can you express yourself in english ?
she always gets lost .
he traveled all over the world .
he was standing at the side of the road .

english is spoken in many countries around the world .
how long have you been looking for it ?
i was attracted to the girl .
we have more music coming up , so stay tuned .
the buses run every ten minutes here .
i 'm sorry i didn 't quite catch what you said .
you must take the fact into consideration .
my sister is engaged to him .
i spent idle days during the vacation .
a few days later , he came .
it 's better as it is .
you can believe me , because i heard this news first hand .
please open the door .
may i use your car , dad ?
if i were you i 'd be able to succeed .
have you finished your homework ?
is everybody ready for the trip ?
do you think he will really give up ?
television has a great appeal for him .
i wonder what happened .
ah , this hot water 's good !
mr hill went on a journey to japan yesterday .
they went on a trip a few days ago .
his brother was lost in the town .
they work for so much a week .
he is takes pride in his son .
this book is popular with students .
he is now almost as tall as his father is .
i don 't know much about computers .
need anything else ?
there are many famous old buildings in kyoto .
he didn 't run fast enough to catch the train .
he advised me to go there .
i can do without this .
ken went as far as aomori this summer .
he runs very fast .
he wants a new car .
he isn 't a diligent student .
tom was so careless as to leave his camera in the bus .
it goes without saying that i love you .
it was difficult to carry out the plan .
he turned up an hour later .
in the meantime , she began to cry .
it 's heartbreaking .
whose car is that ?
was it cloudy in tokyo yesterday ?
i 'm just going to drop by the post office .

you really must stop smoking .
the busiest men find the most time .
bite together , please .
it just turned out that i had to do it .
i have only a small garden .
i can 't afford to buy a car .
my hotel told me to call you .
i 'm thinking he was a kind man .
i found the box empty .
you will be up against many difficulties .
her name was spelled wrong .
i grew up in this small town .
how long do you plan to stay in this country ?
it seems that jack is sick .
i 'm used to cooking for myself .
we all made preparation for the meeting .
does your father get home early ?
how do you want them ?
if only the rain would stop !
i can 't bear the noise any longer .
there were lots of people .
i started last in the race .
tell me how you solved the problem .
my sister is pretty .
don 't speak ill of others behind their back .
there may be two cases here .
even the teacher could not solve the problem .
needless to say , getting up early is important .
which is your book ?
all of them are not present .
please tell me when he 'll arrive here .
she didn 't know the information till she met him .
i will make some coffee .
the room is full of people .
i 'm going to leave one night early .
spring is come .
my father didn 't allow me to marry him .
i forgot that i met her last month .
the discussion went on till late at night .
he went far in business .
this was his one and only hope .
the man robbed the old man of the bag .
you 'd better not go out .
he took part in the race .
she cannot have told a lie to me .
you should avail yourself of the chance to go abroad .
he always took a seat in the front row .
i like to shop at that department store .
that 's a job of your own a choosing , isn 't it ?
the food was not bad , as hotel food goes .
you 're better off not getting in his way !
it 's a nice day , isn 't it ?
we have supper at six every evening .
i cannot quite understand it .
do you know how to speak english ?
i don 't regret coming here .
what are you doing this evening ?
it 's too much trouble to walk there .
i had my brother put this room in order .
mother made me a doctor .
what is the temperature ?
he is the best for this project .
i feel kind of sorry for him .
money does not always bring happiness .
it is not important whether we win the game or not .
i returned to japan .
please do so by all means .
you must be kidding !
my car is a used one .
you know many interesting places , don 't you ?
you can rely on their coming on time .
this room is used as a kitchen .
he will come after all .
she is now better off than when she was young .
how nice to see you again , tom .
you don 't have to stay to the end .
for what purpose did you break into the house ?
how fast she swims !
he doesn 't look himself this morning .
he played tennis all day long .
mother , father , look at your little monster .
he is a very earnest person .
you had better not sit up late at night .
you should attend to your business .
what is going on ?
did you have a good time at the dinner ?
his idea doesn 't make any sense at all .
where did we leave off last time ?
he is a man of great ability .
okay . drive safely .
we 'll go for a drive next sunday .
not a few pupils could solve the problem .
his knowledge of english is poor .
he doesn 't read many newspapers .
i 'm all thumbs .
please come to see me from time to time .
i met fred on the street .
a great party that was .
he often goes to tokyo .
i 'll be there by eight somehow .
he took no notice of my advice .
i 'd like a wake-up call at six tomorrow morning .
is it hot over there ?
can i go hiking next sunday ?
night always follows day .
don 't try to do all these things at once .
do a better job next time .
my house is just across the street .
you had better not see her now .
do you have anything to do after that ?
please don 't let him know the real name of his illness .
he takes a bath every morning .
i keep nothing a secret from you .
it seems that he is aware of the fact .
i am much concerned about your health .
i asked tom about his new book .
they are singers .
he won fame by the novel .
we watched them play baseball .
english is studied all over the world .
he gave money to each of his sons .
his daughter and my son are good friends .
i can 't put up with his violence any longer .
the failure is due to his carelessness .
your work is far from being satisfactory .
i should think she is over sixty .
no students went there yesterday .
you take him to the hospital .
people love freedom .
choose between the two .
i know how you feel .
she is a slow runner .
by the way , where do you live ?
the bill must be paid today .
i want to see the streets .
i mean , when i watch t. v. i 'd sit in it .
he contradicted the news .
i advised him to keep that promise .
my house was robbed while i was away .
what is the difference between this and that ?
the picture is true to life .
they know how to swim .
they are all in a hurry to catch a train .

he made the children laugh .
i am going to write a letter .
he kept waiting for hours and hours .
he cannot come out of the room until ten .
john , a friend of mine , told me so .
the accident was due to his carelessness .
he will be pleased to help you .
how soon does the concert begin ?
the committee are all present .
can i see this one ?
can you tell me when the next bus will arrive ?
she is more beautiful than any other girl .
i wonder what this phrase means .
he was exposed to danger .
the dream came true .
look at that big dog .
he is afraid of the dog .
we had a lively party last night .
this problem baffles me .
you must bear in mind what i 've just said to you .
how about having our lunch in the park ?
she is having lunch now .
there is a post office in front of the station .
i am short of money .
it 's impossible to take on more work at the moment .
eat whatever you like .
it 's difficult to feel at home in a foreign language .
i may have made a mistake .
both the parents are still living .
choose any one from among these .
no one gave up hope .
they went on working for hours .
give me something cold to drink .
bob helped me .
i never give up .
what was his motive for doing it ?
he is my teacher .
she is happy to have conceived a baby by him .
this is a dress of mary 's own making .
how many days will you remain in london ?
please give me a sheet of paper .
it happened that i was free last sunday .
she had a choice of going or remaining .
his parents took him for a walk .
i don 't like your going out alone .
she asked mary to find her little boy .
the offer is too good to turn down .
really it looks good in .

you all right ?
he did it all out of kindness .
make yourself at home .

i can walk to school in ten minutes .
my watch loses three minutes a day .
he is sure to succeed .
my son will take over the job .

several of my friends have been to japan this year .

the heavy snow kept us from going out .
tom denied having stolen the money .
i am very interested in french .

i don 't know about things like that .
here is a new video for them to watch .
whose go is it ?
this room is pleasant to work in .
a car bouncing along a bad road .
i 'm not certain we can get tickets tonight .
there was nothing for it but to give up my plan .
she is two years senior to you .
may i ask you to do me a favor ?
this coat doesn 't fit me .
i sometimes go out for a walk .
there was a two hour 's interval to the next train .
he seldom , if ever , comes .
he 's in bed with the flu .
the moon is a satellite of the earth .
i often look back at my younger years .
all of them were gone .
after two days our food gave out .
how do you account for your being late ?
i left the money at his disposal .
i was at my wit 's end when i heard the news .
i seem to have caught a bad cold .

were i you , i would study harder .
they are as poor as can be .
he was better off when he was young .
i can teach english .
he is a man of virtue .
i like red wine better than white .
a friend of mine went to america this summer .

i stopped smoking and drinking .
it seems that he was half asleep then .
my mother is really of the old school .
how many pictures did you buy ?
i 'll be busy tomorrow .
will we be in time for the train ?
he gave me a good piece of advice .
may i talk with you for a moment ?
lend a hand with these parcels , please .
we are a family of four .
i will have to study harder .
this is the very dictionary that i have been looking for .
what has become of your dog ?
he started after he had a cup of coffee .
don 't you have anything to do ?
my father played golf on the sunday morning .
he visited japan while he was president .
this is all i can do for you .
this is the shortest way to the station .
he lives in that yellow house .
let 's do the dishes .

we were never to see her again .
she is a stranger to me .
health is the most precious thing we have .
there 's a hole in this .
where can i put my bag ?
because all his friends were poor , too .

yesterday evening we heard the president talk on television .

we were all running short of money then .
she parted from her friend in tears .
i shouldn 't wonder if they came after all .
what time do you usually get up ?

to him the five minutes seemed like as five hours .
you had better not go there again .
where shall we meet ?
she 's loved by her friends .
you are wrong , however .
this new singer is really great .
i 've never heard of such a frightening story before .
how about a cup of cocoa ?
we can do nothing about it .
this dictionary is of great use .
some boys came into the classroom .
do you mind if i turn off the light ?
