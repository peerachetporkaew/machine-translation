what is the principle reason for going to school ?
let 's begin with that question .
i like to adorn her room with flowers .
a young child has a small vocabulary .
i 'll miss you .

your answer does not make sense .
we need another person to play cards .
don 't touch the flowers .
so much for today 's work .

does she work in this city ?
his speech continued for three hours .
he opened the door .
she came down to breakfast at eight .

and spent that day with him .
she came an hour beyond the appointed time .
you know nothing of the world .
his father calls him tom .
do you want to go to dinner today ?

popular or not , it is right .
there is little furniture in my house .
i have a great deal to do today .
he is employed in a bank .
he arrived two days previously .
he worked hard in order to get the prize .
you can 't wring any more money from me .
they started one after another .

let 's be going now .
i 'm no better at cooking than my mother .
his clothes didn 't match his age .
traveling by sea is a lot of fun .

the flowers brightened the room .
i like to draw pictures .

i am not sure but she may come .
this is much the better of the two .
whose books are those ?
he likes to walk about in the park .
he has a large number of books .
he is more gentle than kind .
can you see fish swimming in the water ?
please tell me your name .
they are all in arms .
i am paid 10 dollars an hour .
that has no bearing on our plan .
the thing is , i don 't really want to .
in times like this , there 's nothing like a hair of the dog .
he is much taller than i am .
there was a fire near the train station last night .
my son is now as tall as i am .
even children can read this book .
he didn 't give me anything to eat .
i feel very feverish .
he abstained from smoking .
i nearly made a mistake .
let 's reserve that for another occasion .
please reserve this table for us .
at last he found out the truth .
i stayed at a hotel on a hill in that town .
i don 't know for certain when he will come .
i want to live in comfort .
i 'm counting on you .
he turned to his friends for help .
what would you do , if you had a million dollars ?
she is my dream girl .
i think it important to tell him the facts .
since it was raining , we stayed at home .
i can 't see what you mean .
you 're a reporter .
the child was hot with fever .
we had to call off the game because of rain .

with all her faults , i still like her .
he lost the sight of one eye in a traffic accident .
i enjoyed swimming .
i suggested going for a walk .
take this medicine when you have a cold .
i have no particular reason to do so .
he came running .
is it hard to speak english ?
i like coffee very much .
he is very close with his money .
suddenly , a good idea occurred to me .
won 't you come to my house next sunday ?
old mr smith is saving as much money as he can .
how about the taste ?
please tell me what happened to him .
suffice it to say that , after all , this won 't do .
most boys like computer games .
you may take either half of the cake .
i often run into her at the supermarket .
up against the wall !
i found it difficult to understand what he was saying .
i have heard the story .
she regarded the story as a joke .
we had a very good time last night .
i looked for the key .
i made this kennel by myself .
he made her his wife .
we 'll go along with your suggestion .
my friend has a large family .

what would you do , if you were in my place ?
bring me today 's paper .
we are in for rain .
his efforts come to nothing .
i am interested in mountain climbing .
he is not very fast at making friends .
i think that they will be late .
i was able to catch the last train .
my brother goes to college in kobe .
you should always be careful in your speech .
that 's right , isn 't it ?
i think his life is in danger .
it is yet to be seen whether this plan will succeed or not .
homework must be done by tomorrow .
he held out his hand .
we looked , but saw nothing .
have him wait a moment .
he is in want of money .
they were on board the same airplane .
in the first place , we must be careful about what we eat and drink .
the dress comes to my knees .
why are you crying ?
he became the company president when he was thirty .
my older brother is a teacher .
i 'm twice your age .
she turned pale at the news .
the game will be called off if it rains tomorrow .
i met my classmate .
can you stand on your hands ?
i would like you to make tea for me .
she keeps her diary in english .
having walked for sometime , we came to the lake .
i 'm sorry , but he is out now .
i went there to meet him .
i wish there was more variety in my work .
the doctor has saved my life .
if you have any questions , please let me know .
this is an interesting story .
the dog looked into the water .
to change the subject .
don 't worry about the work .
what he says is true to some extent .
you are quite in the wrong .
has father come home yet ?
you don 't need to go in such a hurry .
i have met her before .
so you 've got to be a believer .
are you going to learn english ?
she is an earnest student .
no , i did it on my own account .
please choose between this one and that one .
he knows whatever .
in brief , i need money . please lend it to me !
he walked two miles in half an hour .
i will study abroad when i have finished school .
we should wait here for the moment .
i found him at his books .
he is a good loser .
don 't give up if you fail .
the rain kept us from going out .
what animal is it ?
she began to talk to the dog .
we have a lot of work to do .
i arrived just in time for the plane .
what subjects are you taking at school ?
we are dependent on each other .
i 'm not too clear about that point .
she came out with some strange tunings .
let 's make believe we have one million yen hand .
i could not make myself heard in the noisy class .
by god , i 'll finish this homework .
i haven 't seen him lately .
i don 't like him because he loses his temper easily .
he is master of this house .
he is a gentleman .
may i speak with you ?
the game exhausted me .
quiet down , please .
i did not watch tv but studied english last night .
let 's get started right away .
he was running and calling for help .
this is the most difficult book i have ever read .
the meeting broke up at eight .
i was late because of heavy traffic .
i paid him a visit yesterday .
it is really quite a good story .
every house had a garden .
i 'm freezing .
mary prided herself on her beauty .
we arrived on the morning of the seventh .
i don 't know what to do .
she is good-natured .
where is my seat ?
such a thing can 't happen in japan .
she could not refrain from tears .
why don 't i try to do something about the garden ?
for example , do you like english ?
the garden was filled with flowers .
i do not read his novels .
i don 't want any sandwiches .
how well she is singing !
his opinion is quite different from ours .
it seems that we have lost our way .
she came across the street .
the fact is that he slept late that morning .
this hotel does not take dogs .
there is no denying the fact .
i bought a good camera .
tonight i 've got to do get ready for tomorrow .
he has always devoted himself to music .
we could not open the box anyhow .
ten to one it 'll clear up in an hour or so .
this pair of shoes doesn 't fit me .
all the buses are full .
he is far from being a gentleman .
i 'm afraid she may have the mumps .
could you ring up these books for me ?
don 't be so reserved .

may he live long !
we went down to the valley where the village is .
i 'm tired of watching television .
he is spoken ill of by his students .
would you mind repeating the question ?
i 'm exhausted .
his words hurt her feelings .
newspapers did not report that news .
what makes him hated ?
i am very pleased with my job .
my father is in the hospital now .
the conference is to be held in tokyo the day after tomorrow .

he was happily married .
i 'd like something to eat .
we will go but you won 't .
some day my dream will come true .
the sun is just setting .
we were in london last winter .
when did america become independent of england ?
could you send up a band-aid and some medicine ?
mother told me to behave myself .
i want you to play the guitar for me .
he was hard to please .
i was given a nice watch by my uncle .
i want your opinion .
that isn 't the case in japan .
the reason which he gave is hard to understand .
summer is the season when women look most beautiful .
when i grow up , i want to be an english teacher .
just keep on walking .
he always speaks to me when he meets me on the street .
it is , as it were , a life and death problem .
seeing me , the baby began to cry .
let 's sing a song .
the path is broken .
i want my mother to get well soon .
he did me a good turn .
this coat is warm .
he is a very nice student .
this book is easy enough for me to read .
if you are busy , i will help you .
we will leave in an hour .
i can make nothing of what he says .
i suggested that john be called .
she soon came to believe him .
good morning , everyone .
what pretty flowers !
what a tall boy tony is !
she lost her new watch .
do you know the reason ?
he is not always late .
children should keep away from the river . it 's dangerous .
he will come tomorrow .
how did such a thing come about ?
what do you say to seeing a doctor ?
i thought as much .
she lost to him in tennis .
don 't wake up the sleeping child .
i can 't get rid of this cold .
how did you reply ?
i am now independent of my father .
i have been there scores of times .
i have kids to take care of .
she is his real mother .
the poor girl was on the point of death .
it 's about time you got here !
suppose we change the subject .
he will soon be past playing with toys .
i arrived there too early .
you can depend on his help .
since it was raining , i took a taxi .
his statement really cut me .
hanako is set on going to paris .
my mother knows how to make cakes .
we got involved in a traffic accident .
the job is half done .
he can swim very fast .
he told me to do it .
i adhered to my decision .
she gave away all her dresses .

i was not a good mother .
the girl is friendly to me .
me , too .
i cannot thank you enough .
i believed every word he said .
i ran across an old friend in the street .
the matter is of great importance .

a big tree fell in the storm .
don 't watch tv .
let 's go !
the war lasted two years .
i 'm busy with my homework .
do get up , it 's very late .
the rain prevented me from going .
i wonder where he is now .
how lucky we are !
the paper says that a typhoon is on its way .
he has been speculating on his future .
she had an itch to see her child .
we must abide by the rules of the game .
it being sunday , we have no classes today .
don 't find fault with other people .
i play tennis every sunday .
it is a fact that i don 't know her name .
i would rather stay at home than go out today .
i could make nothing of what he said .
we chartered a bus .
we must be going now .
when it rains , the buses are late more often than not .
i have a slight cold .
i couldn 't get to sleep .
they need daily care .
come round to see me at eight tonight .

tell me when it came about .
your family must be very nice .
young children soon pick up words they hear .
i was made to go there .
jane went to the bank to take out some money .

my sister asked me to lend her the dictionary .
we are students .
what has become of him since then ?
you had better not keep company with him .
she may well be proud of her only son .
open the window . it 's baking hot in here .
even a child can understand it .
you are all too quick .
the house was destroyed by fire .
can you give me a ride to the station ?
no one was to be seen in the street .
i forgot to turn off the tv before going to bed .
my house was robbed while i was away .
quiet him down , will you ?
every student has free access to the library .
a lot of children gathered in the garden .
we gave a ball last week .
i thought that he was honest .
tell me whose hat this is .
am i making myself clear ?
our school is across the river .
would you please call him back later ?
she goes to market every day .
i lost the watch father had given me .
i 'm glad to hear of your success .
let a sleeping dog lie .
how he eats !
you should go and see for yourself .
he 's living from hand to mouth .
i prefer going out to staying home .
he ran out into traffic .
you must be kidding !
do you have a table for five ?
i know you can make it better .
that boy 's hair is black .
he should get to your house in an hour .
know who you are .
he seems to be worried about something .
won 't you go for a walk ?
would you like to wait in the bar ?
i would walk along the river .
please don 't forget to see him tomorrow .
she yelled at the children to be quiet .
i would quit before i would do that job in this company .
we enjoy talking .
she became a doctor .
start this moment .
i met a friend of mine at the airport .
i feel it now .
please help yourself .
how do you like japan ?
only if it 's not too much trouble .
i could not have done it .
dead men tell no tales .
above all , i want to see him again .
it hardly ever rains there .
they say that he was ambitious when young .
we may as well walk as wait for the next bus .
in short , he was too honest .
you should try to cut your way .
i made it myself .
so the captain took care of him .
are you listening to him ?
do you have to go to market , too ?
hurry up , or you 'll miss the bus .
wash your feet .
do you happen to know his name ?
this song reminds me of the good old days .
she lives in the village .
they did not wish to go any farther .
i 'll bring it to you tomorrow .

he called me up almost every day .
i 'm studying the american drama .
take a seat over against her .

what time does the last tokyo train leave ?
he was looked up to by all his friends .
because it rained , i didn 't go .
it is no more than ten minutes ' walk from here .

set the clock right . it 's ten minutes fast .
we understand the necessity of studying .
what do you conclude from that ?
i 'm much better today than yesterday .
he turned away the question .
come and help us .
you must be the temporary we asked for .
oh , you 're going home tonight !
he has decided not to go to the meeting .
why don 't you rest a bit ?
put the gun on the table .
who made this plan ?
he was at work till late at night .

ten to one he will succeed .
my father used to go to work by bus .
i can 't sleep at night .

a piano is expensive , but a car is more expensive .
i will be happy to attend your party .
i will meet you off the train tomorrow .
would you care for a drink ?
thank you very much for your hospitality .
he accepted my idea .
can you find the time to play with our daughter ?
all right . i 'll come as soon as possible .
i could not come up to his expectations .
he goes abroad every year .
my toothache returned in a few hours .
i don 't work on sunday .
i tried everything to keep him alive .
this river is very dangerous to swim in .
let 's go back before it begins to rain .
he was not aware of the danger .

i was constrained to tell a lie .
he looked unfriendly at first .
i was revived by a glass of water .
the airplane soon went out of sight .
i like taking a walk in the forest .
no living thing could live without air .
which way will you take ?
don 't run risks .
the job of a driver is not as easy as it looks .
after ten minutes ' walk we came to the museum .
those men are of a generation .
where 've you been keeping yourself ?
hurry up , and you will be in time .
kate went to a party to see her friend .
he never pays much attention to what his teacher says .
ken has been looking for you .
i like mahjong .
i mentioned your name to him .
he looked out of the window .
this book has a lot of pictures .
he walked up and down the room .
i don 't need any bit of your charity .
i 'd like the same style as this one .
i discussed the matter with her .
she left the baby crying .
speak louder so everyone can hear you .
it 's stormy .
will you make room for me ?
he was wet all over .
after i locked all the doors , i went to bed .
don 't leave it open .
that 's a bad day for me .
i remember my mother when i see this .
we were moved to tears .
she was kind enough to help me .
it is her that i want to meet .
i had no notion that you were coming .
thank you for the shipment .
she said she would be back right away .
start by doing the books .
is he anything of a scholar ?
what do you say to waiting five more minutes ?
lots of famous people come here .
she mentioned my name in her book .
it 's awfully cold today .
i feel like taking a walk now .

i don 't mind getting up at six .
i am to meet him at five at the station .
while staying in tokyo , i came to know her .
i took her for an american .
she married him for the sake of his family name .
he lives near here .
do you mean that you have already decided on this plan ?
he is popular with the people at large .
they confronted each other .
could you put it in plain language ?
it soon began to rain very hard .
you boob ! i should not have asked you .
i 'm sorry for your not having come with us .
we had a lot of fun at the skating .
the exhibition is well worth a visit .
may i take a shower in the morning ?
i 'm very sleepy today , too .
it 's not just you , i am also to blame .
why are you crying ?
have you finished ?
even a child knows right from wrong .
let me go in place of him .
i dreamt i was a bird .
there is no telling when the war will end .
as i was tired , i took a rest .
the children were playing at keeping house .
mother prepared us lunch .

the class were divided in their opinion .
let me have a look at it .
the french president is to visit japan next month .

i have no information she is coming .
put this japanese into english .
such being the case , he is unable to pay .
are they writing a letter ?
how long will you stay here ?
to all appearance it is true .
this report isn 't to the point .
he has a big future in baseball .
we are watching tv .
we are all anxious about your health .
he nodded to me .
a number of books were stolen .
mother went to town to get some bread .
there wasn 't a single book in the room .
i feel well today .

once i lived in osaka .
you should always tell the truth .
our train was an hour late because of the heavy snow .
i don 't know who he is .
she pondered the question for a while .
are you ready to order now ?
you should be kind to others .
he must have seen it .
in fact , i was there .
now i must go about my work .
you must consider it before you answer .
we carried out that plan .
not a word did she say to me .
i live about an hour from the station .
i am to take over my father 's business .
she cannot have done such a thing .
i hope you 'll be happy forever .

you must not get away from reality .
they gave us very little trouble .
this door will not open .
he can speak french well .
we had better begin to prepare for the test .
we have plenty of time .
have a cup of tea , won 't you ?
do you like the piano ?
we had a wonderful holiday .
just take it easy .
i can 't make out what she said .
he has something to do with the matter .
the game was called off on account of the rain .
i can make nothing of it .
she pointed out my mistake .
i 'll wait here until my medicine is ready .
i owe what i am today to my father .

you will succeed in the end .
she ended up getting married to him .

i have heard nothing from him since then .
say with one 's own lips .
you are right to a certain extent .
peace will come to us in time .
he seems to know the secret .
it is up to you to decide what to do .
the woman who came here yesterday is miss yamada .
we used to meet on our way to school .
i like soccer best .

that is the way things went for a while .
they didn 't tell me so .
let the problem alone .
he was playing with a toy .
can i borrow your radio ?
he sees everything in terms of money .
he passed among the crowd .
how does this bear on my future ?
i was not aware of his presence .
we work from nine to five .
it is impossible to put the plan into practice .
words failed me .
the best is best cheap .
there 's no soap .
she took to her new teacher .
i 'd like to have dinner with you .
i 'm very sorry i came home so late .
i walked along the main street .
the girl went to sleep .
she cannot have been ill .

i went to the airport to meet my father .
he went out for a walk with his dog .
slow down or you 're going to work yourself sick .
they worked hard day and night .
he was no longer dependent on his parents .
the little boy is afraid of the dark .
it was nice and cool there .
he was bewildered on that day .
when the bus came , she got on .
you are a good cook .
i turned to him for advice .
this will bring you to grief .
do you have a vision of your future ?
he is ashamed to ask questions .
they seem to make nothing of the problem .
either of them is honest .
this dictionary is by far the best .
alice has had a cold since last sunday .
shall we take this outside ?
i heard someone scream .
would you like to come in for an interview next week ?

it doesn 't matter whether he agrees or not .
he commanded us to work hard .
i didn 't believe him at first .

that means sure death !
she looks like a teacher .
who planned that trip ?
work hard so that you can succeed .

she should have arrived home by now .
ken makes it a rule to get up early .
how 's it going with your family ?
you are all that is dear to me in the world .
you should have accepted his advice .
we agreed to his suggestions .
my wife is a good manager .
his account of the accident accords with yours .
please take good care of yourself .

he seems to have been ill .
she is happy .

the rain was driving against the windows .

never did i expect that he would fail the examination .
i took it for granted that he would succeed .
please sign your name here .
can you cook a meal ?
can 't you wait just ten more minutes ?
the children were playing about .
it is contrary to reason .
i was here all the time .
it makes no difference to me .
just then , i heard the telephone ring .
i see your cat in the garden .
there is much truth in what you say .
she is as busy as a bee .
new york is worth visiting .
what newspaper do you take ?
here comes jane . do you know her ?
this city has a big tv station .
his story sounds strange .

i have already had my breakfast .
why don 't you ask for a pay raise ?
how much money do you want ?
i 'd like to stay at your hotel .
she takes care of my children .
i 'd like you to read this book .

not worth speaking of .
that he should say such a thing !
the level of the school is high .
i 'd like to come to see the doctor as soon as possible .
the fire has gone out and this room is cold .
she caught my eye .

the building may crash at any time .
take this medicine in case you get sick .
it seems she is more than thirty years old .
the accident resulted from his carelessness .
they are free from care and anxiety .
you don 't understand .
it is easy to find fault with the work of others .

this is the only thing that was left .
i am not more intelligent than him .
though it was raining , she went out .
i often heard her sing that song .

the moon was mirrored in the lake .
he took pains to write this song .

she gets up late on sunday mornings .
search as we would , we could not find it .
this key admits to his room .

i have made him angry .
they may be playing in the park .
we have respect for our teacher .

he lives near my house .
he knows what he is about .
a man of reason could answer the question .
i have five times as many stamps as he does .
the story turned out to be true .
when is your book coming out ?
why not look into the matter yourself ?
do you have a lot of time ?
i asked a favor of him .
my husband has his breakfast while reading the newspaper .
she 's on a roll .
have it your way .
i would rather stay at home .
the day of the picnic has arrived .
the man asked me for some money .
i don 't like it , either .
come into the room .
my mother must be angry .
strange to say , he did pass the exam after all .
the picture has already been finished by him .
see to it that your cigarette is put out before you go to bed .
i can 't remember his name .
will you open the door ?
the party went off beautifully .
he is every bit a politician .
the book read most in the world is the bible .
this desk was too heavy to lift .
the storm sank the boat .
where has she gone ?
it gave me quite a shock .
he cut a poor figure after his long illness .
he gave me food and money as well .

i 'd like to go to the zoo .
something has happened to the engine .
the children were going to make sport of her .
who did you meet there ?
i know only this .
it is by no means an easy job .
everybody laughed at me .
do you see any policeman over there ?
he walked ahead of me .
your english leaves much to be desired .
it was a poor concert .
he is a tennis champion .
she blushed seeing it .
once you are married , you are done for .
a boy ran off with some money .
he came from tokyo yesterday .
have a nice trip !
you ought to keep working while you have your health .
there is no rule without exceptions .
we finally decided to give him over to the police .
among those present was the mayor .
and , we get each other 's company to boot .
they are champing to start at once .
she had a strange hat on .
i can 't hold with such a politician .
my child is curious to know everything .
which is larger , japan or britain ?
he went out just now .
this problem is so easy that i can solve it .
something is wrong with the engine .
how soon can you have this dress ready ?
i love comic books .
could you get me some tea ?
she couldn 't answer the question .
how many people came to the zoo yesterday ?
please take off your shoes .
do you have any apples ?
if only i knew his address .
it is such a hard job for that reason .
they are out shopping .
his house is just across from the post office .
perhaps i 'll like this book .
she went so far as to call him a fool .
i don 't mean to make you worry .
i cannot agree to your proposal .
seen from the moon , the earth looks like a ball .
look about you .
we went along with his plan .
tell me what you want .
he is concerned about the result of the exam .
i made him do so .
it seems that they have quarreled .
he is taller than his father .
i had a pleasant dream last night .
she went into teaching .
this time it does not fail .
may they live long !
john will be here in five minutes .
the fireman soon put the fire out .
i had nothing to do with that incident .
i make little of the problem .
i 'm sorry , you are not allowed to .
i wonder who they are .
let 's keep this a secret .
my father 's hair has grown white .

i am pleased to help you if i can .
what have you done about fixing the car ?
we think it possible that they may arrive next week .
what do you think of the new teacher ?
they were not sure whether they could come or not .

you can say whatever you want to .
he is a cruel person .
he is most happy about his success .
he is different from before .

you must think of your old parents .
may i speak to bill ?
it is likely that he did it on purpose .

what a beautiful sunset .
how are relations between the two of them going ?
i am looking for an assistant .
you ought to see a doctor .
he reproached me for carelessness .
i don 't think so .
he concealed the fact from me .
are you going to have dinner at home ?
get your carcass out of here !
she begged him to send her home .
he has been to switzerland before .
you should always think before you speak .
they will get married in due course .
make sure you have reserved a room at the hotel .
he hasn 't answered my letter yet .
what on earth are you doing in my room ?
there was a fine scent in the room .

i visited paris long ago .
what a waste of water !
he stood there for a while .
this is by far the best way .
will he be able to come tomorrow ?
in my opinion , he is wrong .
be on your guard against her .
it is otherwise correct .

he seldom , if ever , goes to the movies .
he drowned in the river .

the train arrived on schedule .
i paid a matter of fifty dollars .

i think i will occupy myself in my father 's business .
my wife burst into tears .
i left off work for a few hours to see the doctor .
the mother seemed busy cooking .
she invited her friends to dinner .
i 'm busy preparing for the trip .
you can 't imagine it , can you ?
i take the liberty of going home .

this hotel is relatively expensive for this town .
i hit it off badly with her .
it takes twenty minutes to walk from the station to school .
he runs well for his age .
i think i 'm gonna go to sleep .
that 's too bad .
mr tanaka , you are wanted on the phone .
three coffees , please .
i don 't have any money on me .
if you don 't look out , you will get into trouble .
he finally broke up with that woman .
we took a direct road to town .
our idea did not work in practice .
my homework was finally finished .
as to me , i agree to the plan .
tom is as tall as his father .
he never takes any notice of what his father says .
she didn 't buy the ticket after all .
he had no sooner heard the news than he began to cry .
such behavior may bring about an accident .
i can 't stand to watch you .
it will be some time before he gets well .
i 'm sorry to hear the news .
my watch loses three minutes a day .
he is coming to see me tomorrow afternoon .
may i put my seat back ?
could you be a little quieter , sir ?
there is little room for doubt .
our principal made a long speech .
i wonder what the weather will be tomorrow .
the man finally confessed what he had done .
could you spare me a few minutes ?
i was surprised at the news this morning .
i am eager to be present at the party .
would it be better to start early ?
we should love our neighbors .
playing tennis is a lot of fun .

the music carried me back to my childhood .
he is known to all the people in the town .
that matter will take care of itself .
i am sorry your plan counts for nothing .

she 's a glamorous girl .
it is cloudy today .

i have breakfast at seven every morning .
i will bear your words in mind .
we used to talk over a cup of coffee .

give me some more tea .
she didn 't come after all .
do you still get in touch with them ?
i met again the girl who i had met in the park the other day .

she is more famous than you .
i adore going to the cinema .
he was robbed when coming home late at night .
i will answer for his honesty .
i got my hair cut .

i 'll be glad to help him .
do you remember me ?
i 'd like a book .
where did you get to know her ?
i have a pricking pain here .
he will object to your going abroad .
excuse me . may i get through ?
he isn 't as honest as all that .
i lost my watch .
i would like to tell you something .
what kind of test is that ?
she easily catches cold .
you must not go up the stairs .
she caught me by the arm .
we are anxious for your help .
please refrain from smoking here .
i feel my age .
i do love you .
their plan resulted in failure .
i put up a notice .
he 's a strange character .
please take care of yourself .
there is a cat under the bed .
it will be a good lesson to him .
it may well rain before tonight .
only a few students understood the matter .
of course , you may .
once in a while he tells strange things .
it is not a matter to laugh about .
i feel like doing something different today .
i can no longer stand the cold .
you should consider the problem .
there must be something wrong with the machine .
she is herself again .
to tell the truth , we got married last year .
look out of the window .
he made a fool of his teacher .
all the students come from the us .
i stayed with my uncle .
i am unconcerned with the problem .
to speak a foreign language well takes time .
there was once a time when i could not trust others .
he may have seen it .
i don 't believe him any longer .
i will make you happy .
there is a cat under the desk .
his old car don 't get a cent .

he painted a picture of a dog .
it 's all the same to me .
i have just been to the station to see my uncle off .

i hope you 'll like it .
in japan we have a lot of rain in june .

i cannot agree with you on this .
they regarded him as the best doctor in town .
he is swimming in the pool .
all you have to do is to work harder .
please turn on the light .
please permit me to ask you some questions .
the house is owned by him .
his story turned out to be false .
who is the girl in this picture ?
we are afraid .
i wonder why he is late .
could you tell me the way ?
that he will fail is certain .
i arrived in london .
will you kindly show me the way to his house ?
the sun is about to set .
there is no telling what will happen next .
spring is coming soon .
tell her not to get near the dog .
it 's news to me .
above all , be kind to old people .
why are your eyes so big ?
he could not send his son to school .
i 'm afraid he cannot come .
he and i share a room .
english is the world 's language .
on sunday , we would get up early go fishing .
nobody could give the correct answer .
she has done us many kindnesses .
please speak as slowly as possible .
in a sense , it is true .
i doubt his story .
it would be better for you to speak to him .
what is in the garden ?
when did he arrive here ?
she turned down the radio .
he had little , if anything , to say .
get on a horse .
how do you feel today ?
it is said that he will go abroad .
how many days does it usually take to get there ?
i 'm very sorry about the mistake .
who is that gentleman ?
it looks like he will win .
we communicate with each other by telephone every day .
you are not old enough to go swimming by yourself .
the story was true .
she was encouraged by the news .
they as well as you are ordinary people .
he was angry with his son .
one more person will be joining us later .
come and see me once in a while .
what is the problem ?
i want to buy a more expensive watch .
come home before dark .
the problem was very difficult .
after you 've had some tea , carry on practising .
i have a lot of things to tell you .
they looked up to john as their leader .
we went to a restaurant .
he delivered a speech .
my hair is as long as jane 's .
is he going to help us ?
has the fever gone down ?
his son troubled him most .
the party was not altogether pleasant .
he always wears heavy clothes .
i am going to have my watch repaired by john .
her beauty stood out in our class .
keep the room in good order .
he is the only one of my friends that is talented .
we leave for karuizawa this afternoon .
come on , don 't be silly .
where 's convenient for you ?
he crossed me up .
when he heard it , he saw red .
i have made up my mind to work harder .
i 'll try her out as a secretary .
ellen does not speak english .
you 're new , huh ?
i found the book which i had lost the day before .
is this your first visit to this town ?
he loves trains .
tom doesn 't like cheese .
could you let him out ?
it 's already eleven . it 's high time you were in bed .
he is hard to please .
are they american ?
the picture was taken from the air .
we had plenty of snow last year .
he will come in a moment .
when will you next visit ?
i am tall .
this is the camera which i bought yesterday .
it was shining in the sky .
i am interested in history .
her hands are full taking care of the baby .
this is all i know .
i will be seeing her again one of these days .
i want to execute the plan by all means .
that 's very naughty of you .
we are human .
i always have a look at the newspaper before breakfast .
i would often take a walk before breakfast .
will you lend me your bicycle ?
here are a few coppers .
the teacher told me study harder .
do you have anything cheaper ?
i came to the realization too late to make a difference .
he 's got not only a motorbike but also a car .
she has gone out .
you should have come home before .
it is preferable that he gets there by tomorrow .
this car is running less smoothly than it used to .
get out your wallet .
i have been busy writing a short story .
will you go to america next month ?
he reached for the book .
they are all irritable .
i will not go the length of saying such things .
my brother will often sit up all night .
i got to the station this morning .
in fact , the man got angry .
he told me that he wanted to leave the company .
the more we have , the more we want .
the cup broke .
be quiet , all of you .
it is very cold here .
i was waiting for a taxi .
i like to travel alone .
my father gave up smoking .
she kept me waiting for a long time .
i got cold , so i put on my coat .
we hardly had enough cake for every boy .
she soon adjusted herself to the new school .
i take a bath every morning in summer .
please phone me when you have settled down .
all of us got into the car .
they are always complaining .
everybody likes him .
i could not but laugh at his joke .
let 's drink to absent friends .
the child got angry and struck at his mother .
his speech was too short .
it was very lucky for me that i saw him .
it must be hard for you .
nothing was to be seen but water .
he was kind enough to lend me money .
several of them are opposed to the bill .
i don 't believe such a story .
can i please have something hot to drink ?
your method is different from mine .
the weather outlook for tomorrow is not good .
i was tired of watching tv .
the time is yet to come .
i looked at his face carefully .
the weather will remain cold for several days .
we arrived here at six yesterday evening .
no , no ! that 's not right .
to tell the truth , she is my niece .
you had better talk as clearly as you can .
i don 't like her .
he need not get up so early .
my brother was expert in handwork .
her beauty was beyond description .
speak louder , please .
we still have plenty of time .
he is having lunch .
i want to go home .
you must observe those rules .
now she is gradually getting well .
his novel had a great vogue for a long time .
let 's leave the problem until tomorrow .
if i knew it , i would tell you .
i like sachiko better .
do you have a cheaper room ?
she does not want to be dependent on her parents .
for my part , i have no objection to the proposal .
it is very difficult for you to do this work .
the operation is quite free from danger .
his opinion is different from mine .
do you know why they stopped talking ?
they were swimming .
every means has not been tried .
i was impressed by his music .
i will do my best to put such an idea out of your head .
the storm blew up .
not all children like apples .
i have to take some money out of the bank .
do come if you can !
here is my bicycle .
they were waiting for the gate to open .
it is high time you were in bed .
put your room in order .
she ate her dinner .
what would you like to be called ?
i got it , ok ?
she is right in her opinions .
did you call me up last night ?
he is without parallel .
that child is a headache .
she got the ticket for nothing .
she is very fond of dogs .
this is the largest dictionary there is in this library .
he is opposed to the new plan .
could you send this letter to japan ?
i don 't think she cares very much .
you better believe it .
i must get my watch repaired .
he was listening to music in his room .
i 'm sure he will carry out his promise .
don 't always take sides with him .
please be certain to answer the phone .
did you enjoy yourself at the party ?
what a man you are !
she wrote down what he said .
i want to travel with you .
he promised to sell .
it is not so hot today as yesterday .
i would like to address two questions .
here we are finally at the airport .
he is used to getting up early .
she lived up to our expectations .
i was surprised to hear her voice in the next room .
i will write to him at once .
you cannot have your own way in everything .
look before you leap .
she will be here this evening .
i feel like another beer .
tell him where he should go .
my father was busy .
i don 't feel like doing my math homework now .
put away your books and notebooks .
which bag is yours ?
there are several peoples in the country .
you ought to see a dentist .
it isn 't hard to do .
do you have any french wine ?
his brother passed away last month .
i 'll pick you up at your home at five .
the fault is on the part of my father .
i can speak english .
watch your step .
his behavior is sometimes strange .
may i take your order ?
he has dozens of english books .
i can understand french to a certain extent .
the browns were all kind to me .
it is stupid of you to lend him your money .
this bridge is three times as long as that .
the rich are not always happy .
what 's on the air this evening ?
that is not quite what i wanted .
i saw the man enter the room .
it has resulted in nothing .
if it rains , the game will be put off .
you must not keep in touch with him .
you shall not for nothing as long as i live .
is anything the matter with him ?
please forgive me .
life is at best very short .
please take care not to break this vase .
we made him go .
its value had trebled .
i met her by chance .
the pain was terrible .
shall we stop in at a coffee shop ?
one day in july , we went to the sea .
the event came about like this .
they say that old house is haunted .
milk does not keep long on a hot day .
he is concerned about his parent 's health .
take it easy .
it goes without saying that good health is more important than wealth .
i am too ashamed to do it .
do not read such a book .
i have lost my key .
i had just finished my homework when he visited me .
why don 't you try a different tack ?
it looks as if you 're right .
i 'm afraid it will rain tomorrow .
there was a fire near the house today .
he never fails to call his mother on her birthday .
i don 't care what will become of me .
as is often the case with him , he was late again .
i 'm tired .
it is useless to talk to him .
would you like some more tea ?
but for air , nothing could live .
we learn english at school .
i 'd like to get a refund .
that 's not a bad idea .
we can pay 100 dollars at most .
we took part in the discussion .
he is quite frank with me about everything .
school begins in april .
a heavy snow kept us from going to school .
this is what i can do for you .
we parted at the station at three .
that is the exactly the same idea as i have .
how is the weather today ?
please make yourself at home here .
he is a good carpenter .
we had no choice but to go there .
i would like to speak english fluently .
i hear it 's buried under all that snow .
i am running short of money .
i can 't stand being laughed at in front of others .
i take it for granted that you will join .
can i make an outside call by this phone ?
to begin with , we have no money now .
he is like a brother to me .
i want to be with him all the way .
the store is across the street .
how long has it been snowing ?
thank you very much for your hospitality today .
i ought to have made a hotel reservation earlier .
she was at a loss for words .
when is your birthday ?
he put terms on his problem .
she agreed to my idea .
let me in , please .
my sister has a very good brain .
we have had a long spell of hot weather .
he was not anxious for fame .
the plane is on the way from tokyo to italy .
you will write a letter .
i heard the boys singing .
a baby is incapable of taking care of itself .
do you believe that there is life after death ?
the boy is over there .
the door remained closed before her .
i 'm very slow at making up my mind .
i bought this yesterday .
it will be fine tomorrow .
make one 's hair stand on end .
you say you changed schools .
the garden is in front of the house .
i have a friend waiting for me in the lobby .
many beautiful flowers bloom in spring .
i 'd like to give you a piece of advice .
life is like a journey .
his father doesn 't play golf .
i go to the library two or three times a week .
i 'm not a bit tired .
he is apparently responsible for it .
the sun has gone down .
it looks appetizing .
i got a letter from her today .
he has distorted my speech .
i made friends with him .
you may as well keep it a secret .
don 't phone her now .
how was your summer vacation ?
please show me another one .
most girls are kind .
she turned down our proposal .
that is not my idea of him .
were you reading a book at that time ?
we will begin the meeting when bob comes .
she is a teacher .
that was why he entered the university .
she came home just now .
a number of japanese people travel abroad every summer .
it was sultry last night .
what are you doing so hard ?
the doctor advised my father to stop smoking .
he lived here for a time .
i hope you will get well soon .
please let me in .
ouch ! my foot !
someone seems to be calling me .
you may use my new car .
we saw her enter the park .
you are right to a certain extent .
i approve of your plan .
he has been loved by all .
she burst into tears to hear the news .
how high is that mountain ?
can i take pictures here ?
did your parents approve of your marriage ?
leave that box where it is .
this watch is expensive .
i don 't think any of those horses is going to win .
she looked him in the face .
don 't leave the door open .
this is an interesting book .
what do you want ?
let 's talk quietly in order not to wake the baby .
she is as beautiful as ever .
you will be allowed to go out soon .
i play the piano for amusement .
he doesn 't know how to play the guitar .
we cannot tell which is better .
he is humble about his opinion .
he is a man of understanding .
she must have been sick .
i have a few books .
we sat on the bench in the park .
karen is not angry with me .
we saw a strange object in the sky .
he brought back his child in his car .
nothing is as pleasant as a walk in the morning .
i 'll take the yellow one .
i am off duty tomorrow .
we were forced to work hard .
did you enjoy yourself ?
she wept over her son 's death .
do you know him at all ?
don 't get off the train till it stops .
is this the town where mika was born ?
i would rather you hadn 't told him the truth .
i bet it will rain tomorrow .
is this canadian money ?
the boy who spoke to me was a new student .
they are looking into the problem .
can you tell me how to get to the station ?
i am afraid of dogs .
this is what i want .
he died leaving his beloved children behind .
i found it easy to solve the problem .
i don 't think it will rain this afternoon .
this watch is my father 's .
this is my bag .
he is not so old as my brother .
easy come , easy go .
his success encouraged me very much .
he could make his way in life .
he came out with an angry face .
we expect that he 'll help us .
i was too happy to sleep .
she continued studying all her life .
a short walk will bring you to the station .
i saw something strange in the sky .
i live in an apartment .
i watched tv at six last night .
i like listening to music .
it 's for a friend of mine .
john kept his head above water .
this is the best camera in the store .
this is the house where he was brought up .
his brother is a very capable doctor .
i have almost no money with me .
where is the nearest station ?
please make yourself at home .
she will be late for dinner .
have you decided to go to australia ?
it was his silence which made her angry .
return the money to him at once .
he looked at me and barked .
i quite agree with you .
the news of the air accident left me uneasy .
she was kind enough to help us .
you can go wherever you want to go .
will that idea come off ?
don 't put off answering the letter .
i 'll do it with pleasure .
i 'm going to stay with my uncle in kyoto .
he went to nara .
my birthday is in november .
she gave him her name and telephone number .
mr smith is pleased at his son 's success .
or that was the idea .
keep away from bad company .
i saw her enter the room .
he died one year ago .
let 's take a walk .
her house stands back from the road .
some girls were playing tennis .
a man on horseback came along the path .
excuse me , is this seat taken ?
what 's the cause ?
may i help you clear the table ?
keep your head down .
this plane is his .
at night we can see more stars there than in tokyo .
you may as well go home now .
i am quite ignorant of the plan .
that 's a good idea !
she was scared to death of her husband .
it is going to rain this afternoon .
the dog is called ' spot ' by the family .
i feel for you deeply .
do you like japanese food ?
the police are making every effort to look into the case .
you may depend on him to help you .
she was kind enough to show me the way .

it 's the dry here .
we went to the park to play baseball .
and so the man come in .
i see him once in a while .
he has brown eyes .
don 't spoil the children .
the train was overturned .
do not say such foolish things .
you did wrong in trusting too much in your ability .
i think it 's strange that she was absent from school .
where did you go yesterday ?
he 's sexy .
we 're short of something .
i made an appointment to see the doctor at four o 'clock .
every man in his way .
they were playing tennis .
he kept us waiting for more than an hour .
he fell into a rage .
that problem was accepted .
he took it for granted that she was happy .
i cannot thank you enough .
she is learning the piano .
he would do anything for gain .
it 's a common mistake .
if only i could speak french .
it is impossible to account for tastes .
declare one 's love .
i exchanged some yen for dollars at the bank .
he promised me to come .
i have enjoyed talking to you .
he kept at the job all day .
i should have starved to death for want of food .
how hot it is today !
you have another chance even if you fail this time .
we all enjoyed the film .
it is strange that he should say so .
the old man sat surrounded by the children .
don 't be so self-assertive .
you 're going to a movie ?
the talk dragged on till three o 'clock .
let him alone . he 'll soon come around by himself .
he married ann .
i was writing her a love letter .
tom married an older girl .
where 's the dining car ?
don 't think i 'm joking .
though it was cold , he didn 't light the fire .

no doubt he will pass the examination .
that japanese word has no equivalent in english .
i missed the train by only a few minutes .
you had better do it right now .
my car is under repair .

father has never gotten sick in his life .
can you weigh this , please ?

they don 't like me .
my book is on your desk .
he crossed over to england .
our school has ten classes .
we live on the earth .
i want you to be an einstein .
i never felt at ease in my father 's company .
i 've known him ever since he was a child .
he had some sympathy for the child .
i 'll call him first thing in the morning .
she closed her ears to what he was saying .
how pretty she is .
tom has many talents .
not too well .
how tall he is !
she will make a good wife .
he told me that he was going to italy .
could you put your seat back up a little ?

never be late for school again .
she had the kindness to buy a ticket for me .
i 'm far from happy about this situation .
how far is it from here to the hotel ?
she went out without saying a word .
you don 't have to stand over me .
he is hard to deal with .
she deposited the box on the table .
to our surprise , she revived at once .
this is the very dictionary i 've been looking for .
i helped him walk across the street .
it is said that her father was killed in a traffic accident .
london was a city built for the horse .

my family is under the control of mother .
it is possible that he is telling a lie .
how come you say nothing ?
what is all this bother about ?
he always mistakes me for my sister .
she got to the station at seven .
do you have anything to talk about ?
there is no telling what will happen .
you are free to go or stay .
he came in through the window .
school begins the day after tomorrow .
how is mary ?
do it at once .
all things must have an end .
he turned a deaf ear to my advice .

i bought a new personal computer yesterday .
their married life did not run smoothly .

it is easy for me to play tennis .
she withdrew her head from a window .
we 'll check on it right now .
my mother plays the piano well .
he was in time for school .

it 's hailing .
i wish you could come with us .
he has been sitting there for two hours .
i am suffering from a bad cold .
provided you come back soon you may go .
the moon is not a good place to live on .
she stressed that she did it by herself .
he explained the matter to me .
the other day i came across a book that you might like .
i make it a rule to take a walk for an hour in the morning .
i heard the door close .
what a tall tree it is !
were you to take it back ?
did you bring an umbrella with you ?
i 'm reluctant to visit him .
this problem is beyond my powers .
come what may , i am prepared for it .
it is good to keep studying all your life .
his house was on fire .
three years have passed since we married .
he finally made a name for himself as a politician .
i met with an old friend of mine at the station .

because his father was working there .

naomi has just finished her work .
he looked bewildered .

i 've got no time for that now .
my father doesn 't like soccer .
she put away a good deal of money .
it 's midnight already .
the pupils did the work themselves .
i won 't leave you behind .
father gave an angry look at me .
have you finished your homework ?
i changed trains at tokyo station .
i was embarrassed by what she said .
there were two children playing on the street .
in the end we decided to ask our teacher for advice .
it 's not my cup of tea .
do you believe war will start ?
she is yet to know the truth .
do you have anything on for this weekend ?
she is kind to old people .
you must not be jealous of others ' success .
this is the same watch as i lost .
you will hurt yourself if you 're not careful .
it 's very difficult to understand him .
where have you been all this while ?
she had returned home long before .
tell me about it .
the war went against the country .
no , i didn 't help .
her words were like those of an angel .
she is out now .
you need not have bought the book .
she went to italy with a view to studying music .
she said that she was eager to go there .
my proposal met with a negative .

she was bereft of all hope .
he is proud of being a doctor .
the girl playing the piano is akiko .
she came near being drowned .
by the way , are you free tonight ?
i have a good dictionary .

this problem seems difficult .
he asked me for some money .
is there anything i can do to help ?
she seemed to be very keen on music .
do you have anything to say ?
i have a little time for reading these days .

i am friends with mike .
i 've never heard anything more dreadful .
he made a speech in support of the plan .

why did you choose such a subject ?
it was three weeks before she wrote an answer to tom .
i 'm depending on you .
jane will be excited to see the flowers .
this watch is similar to mine i lost yesterday .
what you said surprised me .
the good news brightened me up .
the baby is called tom .
i don 't like your coming late every time .
boys and girls were parading along the street .
what do you do in your free time ?
i got up at seven .
he is absent from school .
you are certain to be moved deeply by the movie .
we had a wonderful time .
what made you so angry ?
could you change this bill , please ?
no matter how rich people are , they always want more .
your nose is running .
he is a future doctor .
there is no substance in his speech .

after all the pain went away .
it 's too late for regrets .

how long does it take to go from here to the hilton hotel ?
there are some books on the desk .
it is too warm for a fire today .
now and then , i looked up at the sky .
would you tell me the way ?
the problem is who is going to tell him the truth .
it is no wonder that he failed .
you are not to smoke here .
i have a lot of work to do .
the end justifies the means .
this coffee is too bitter .
wait till the rain stops .

playing tennis is fun .
what do i have ?
they are a peace-loving people .
someone is calling you .
will you give me a ride ?
he is apt to be late .
i don 't feel up to running to the station .
what he said counts for nothing .
he said good night to his parents .
he is in a sense a representative of his company .
father intends to go to abroad next week .
you must answer these questions .
my university has a dorm .
he got out from under the car .
i supplied the children with necessary books .

she is being quiet for the moment .
he is quite young in spirit .

he will remember us saying so .
i was a little surprised .

his joke set everyone laughing .
let 's stop here .

i decided to visit the united states on this account .
the result fell short of our expectations .
put the book where you found it .
father took his place at the head of the table .
he will join us later .
you shall want for nothing .

a small car takes little room .
don 't be angry at his words .
they are leaving for tokyo tomorrow .
what happened in consequence ?
i like dogs .
i 'll stay here until ten .
i feel alive .
many of the students were tired .
if you do that kind of thing , it 's not fair to her .
i 'm saying this out of kindness .

the snow prevented me from going out .
i 'm sorry for what i have done .

he has an eye for the beautiful .
i can never thank you enough .
in respect of this question , there are three opinions .
my mother can 't read without glasses .
i didn 't catch your last name .
this is too small a house for us to live in .
one of my pleasures is watching tv .
even a child would notice the difference .
i should have left earlier .
he is hard to deal with .
he broke out into rage .
i had my shoes mended at that store .
he lent me two books .
she went down to the fifth floor .
how does he go to school ?
we 'd better hurry then .
we had to wait a little while for a bus .
we all wish for happiness .

of course i remember the news quite well .
you should take better care of yourself .
if you keep on drinking like that , you 'll get sick .
he works even late at night .
don 't talk about it in his presence .

many young people are out of work in that country .
the moon is low in the sky .
it 's all right on the part of his family .
i get most things at the stores .

we are inclined to stand up for him .
we met at 2 in the afternoon .
he went out for a walk , with his dog following behind .

now let 's get down to work .
she did nothing but weep at the news .
he walks to school .
i hear from him every now and then .
he has been dead for five years .
he moved to tokyo .
who can tell what will happen to her ?
but for language , there would be no thought .
that 's just how i was raised .
the next meeting will take place in a few days .
what 's the big idea ?
do you have any money ?
he went by the name of johnny .
the sun is about to sink .
she seems to be happy .
i bet he will get mad .
yesterday i had my bicycle stolen .
he is an active boy .
what a clever student you are !
it may rain at any time .
it was raining into the bargain .
what a lovely day !
don 't tell him the answer .

she would by no means tell a lie .
your dream may come true at any moment .
mary decided never to see him any more .

his story is true .
you are nothing but a student .
i 'll give him a call tonight .
i sold the picture for 20000 yen .
shall i help you with this box ?
i met him then for the first time .
i believe in you at any rate .
i have known him a long time .
he had no chance to visit us .
learn these names by heart .
the bank isn 't open on sundays .

he reached out for the book .
i am not concerned with this matter .

this desk is better than that one .
he was pleased to hear the news .
i spoke after him .
we are not short of oil in this country .
that will be better than the factory .

i 'm home , mom !
we were all present at the meeting .
she fell on her face .
do you know who he is ?
it is no wonder that he has succeeded .
it took me five hours to finish the work .
which way did you choose ?
eating too much is bad for the health .

i talked with him about it over the telephone .
he was amazed at the sight .
she stood by him .
your book is on the desk .
i got to get out of here .
he can swim faster than any other boy in his class .

he is anything but a scholar .
my house was broken into last night .
he is always on the move .
i don 't know the day when he will come .

i 'm not a bit interested in chemistry .
he left everything to chance .
he ran off to meet his teacher .

please open the door .
may i use your car , dad ?
if i were you i 'd be able to succeed .

tom was so careless as to leave his camera in the bus .

it 's heartbreaking .
whose car is that ?
was it cloudy in tokyo yesterday ?
i 'm just going to drop by the post office .

i have only a small garden .
i can 't afford to buy a car .
my hotel told me to call you .
i 'm thinking he was a kind man .
i found the box empty .
you will be up against many difficulties .
her name was spelled wrong .
i grew up in this small town .
how long do you plan to stay in this country ?
it seems that jack is sick .
i 'm used to cooking for myself .
we all made preparation for the meeting .
does your father get home early ?
how do you want them ?
if only the rain would stop !
i can 't bear the noise any longer .
there were lots of people .
i started last in the race .
tell me how you solved the problem .
my sister is pretty .
don 't speak ill of others behind their back .
there may be two cases here .
even the teacher could not solve the problem .
needless to say , getting up early is important .
which is your book ?
all of them are not present .
please tell me when he 'll arrive here .
she didn 't know the information till she met him .
i will make some coffee .
the room is full of people .

you 'd better not go out .
he took part in the race .
she cannot have told a lie to me .
you should avail yourself of the chance to go abroad .
he always took a seat in the front row .
i like to shop at that department store .
that 's a job of your own a choosing , isn 't it ?
the food was not bad , as hotel food goes .
you 're better off not getting in his way !
it 's a nice day , isn 't it ?
we have supper at six every evening .
i cannot quite understand it .

it 's too much trouble to walk there .
i had my brother put this room in order .
mother made me a doctor .

he is the best for this project .
i feel kind of sorry for him .
money does not always bring happiness .
it is not important whether we win the game or not .
i returned to japan .
please do so by all means .
you must be kidding !
my car is a used one .
you know many interesting places , don 't you ?
you can rely on their coming on time .
this room is used as a kitchen .

my house is just across the street .
you had better not see her now .
do you have anything to do after that ?

he dashed out of the store .
i 'll get in touch with jim and ask him to come over .
i wanna get out of here !
i 'm anxious to see you .

you don 't have to make an apology .
make good use of your time .
the watch was not to be found anywhere .
listen to me carefully .
a foolish idea came into my mind .
he is a man of education .
what 's the accusation against him ?
read such books as interest you .
you don 't have to tell that to your parents .
i have no time to see you .
don 't make a noise .
do you know us ?
i saw her for the last time .
what are you going to do ?
this song always reminds me of my childhood .
he isn 't my cousin .
it 's bigger than any other dog in this town .
i attended the meeting yesterday .
she was careless enough to leave her bag in the bus .
they were free at that moment .
i can 't bear to see her cry .

he provided them with food .
never be this late again .

when shall we leave for the party ?
i bought the girl a sweater .
we hurried to catch the bus .

i stood all the way .
if it were not for water , no living things could live .
people running round .
you had better take account of his age .
she sang pretty well .
this is an immense show .
she is pigeon-toed .
the man lost no time in reading his paper .
he waits on her .
i have already read the book .
do you smoke ?
the man finally confessed .
the busy road is a danger to small children .
the pain was almost unbearable .
an accident often comes of carelessness .
i added a room to my house .
she called me a taxi .
i 'll call back at four o 'clock .

this song reminds me of the good old days .
we are worried about where he is now .
she is far from a fool .
all comes to the same thing .
those are my books .
he spoke slowly enough for everyone to understand .
they supplied money to him .
come on , jiro .
i made a fuss of her family .
someone is calling you .
i would like to repay him for his kindness .
it is stupid of you to believe in him .
we 're having an examination in geometry tomorrow .
what time should i leave the hotel ?
i felt something touch my feet .
i wish i had known his name then .
don 't point at others .
their opinion matters little .

i do not know when she will come back .
mary likes skiing the best of all .
the odds are in his favor .
what time will you have breakfast ?
he lived next to his uncle .
you are everything to me .

he may be a good man for all i know .
i do a lot of work on the school newspaper .
he is particularly kind to her .
make a note of it in order not to forget it .
she and hers are all very well .
before everything you should take better care of your health .
you should have been more careful in money matters .
this car is superior to that .
we learn english at school .
judy is kind to everyone .
how shall we deal with this problem ?

that plan came to nothing .
i alone did it .
you must not come in contact with him .
i agree with you .
i was absent from work yesterday .

how 's it going ?
in the end , they made up their minds to go by plane .

what flower do you like best ?
may i pay with a travelers ' check ?
we have breakfast in the kitchen .
the girl was sick for home .
do you know his brother ?

her eyes fell on the baby .
he went to bed the moment he arrived home .
i found her in tears in her room .
i asked her a difficult question .
i 'm sorry i can 't go with you today .
child as she was , she was not afraid .
your plan is of no earthly use .
you are too suspicious about everything .
they soon arrived at the station on the moon .
i ran out and caught a taxi .
father came home .
i can 't find what i want .
i trusted him with the money .
whenever you come , i 'm ready .
i take full responsibility for the action .
no one can deny the fact .
i appreciate your concern .

he entirely lost his temper with me .
i can 't eat or drink very hot things .
we should try to make the conquest of peace .
i put up with her as long as i could .
it is possible that he will come to our party .
money is a good servant , but a bad master .
english is used in every part of the world .
the result was far from being satisfactory to her .
did you meet her ?
he working all right .
many children were playing in the park .
she seems to be very ill .
there was not a man but had tears in his eyes .

i trust you .
see to it that you don 't make the same mistake .
not only she but also you are wrong .

you should avail yourself of this opportunity without fail .
he told her and she smiled .
that town is two miles away .
please allow me to carry your bag .
they forced him to give in to their opinion .
he is sure to pass the examination .

a nice day , isn 't it ? how about going for a swim ?
every dog has his day .

i have been taking care of him ever since .
he drove carelessly and had an accident .
you need not have bought such an expensive book .
you should try to make the most of your opportunities .
you can rely on him .
my idea is that we should talk to mr brown .
who is that woman holding the flowers ?
after seeing the movie , i was impressed .
tell me about your plan .
the children all had gone to sleep before it got dark .

i hope i 'm not disturbing you .
i pointed my camera at her .
in spring days are not always warm .
i was bidden to stay behind .
please take a look at this picture .
he writes an english letter .
they give presents to one another .
it went just as we expected .
i feel like taking a rest .
the room is ready for us to move into .
i took my child .
i couldn 't tell her from sister .
the house was in good order when we left .
take this box away soon .
come and see this girl out ?
he makes nothing of getting up early in the morning .
my father made me a nice lunch .
his object in life was to become a musician .
you have cleaned your shoes , haven 't you ?
i can 't for the life of me remember her phone number .
it is smaller than tokyo .
how old he is !
i 'd like to see her .
be quiet for a moment .
we still have plenty of time left .
what is done cannot be undone .
stop bothering your father .
he has not less than 100 dollars .
he is a mere child .
there was a big fire last night .
i quite forget your name .
this tv set is the best of all .
it is too early to get up .
she , of all people , wouldn 't do such a thing .
i believe it to be true .
my uncle has lived in paris for ten years .
but i understand what he says .
i studied like anything .
you should have done so .
you will be safe from any danger here .
the man took the boy by the hand .
they made little of the pouring rain .
you should carry out your own plan .
he is rather poor at tennis .
would you lend me your pen ?
i have a message for you from her .
i haven 't seen her since then .
please take care of my baby while i am out .
you may go as long as you come home early .
an american spoke to me at the station .
i washed my hands as usual .
it seems that he left for school just now .
all men must die .
it 's time to take a bath .
milk does not agree with me .
my sister always keeps her room clean .
they are all good men at heart .
she has three brothers .
do you happen to know his name ?
wine is not to my taste .
my father was still at home when i left .
he is a fool , and no mistake .
you shall have a bicycle for your birthday .
father and i go fishing once in a while .
are your hands clean ?
yesterday i hit on a good idea .
get up at seven tomorrow morning .
i haven 't my dictionary at hand .
she should get to the school in an hour .
he is a good tennis player .
which dictionary did you refer to ?
that is to say , on may 10th .
which is older , this book or that one ?
where is your school ?
this is the camera with which he took the picture .
i remember mailing the letter .
how long have they been here ?
even though they were poor , they were happy .
he is a man of his word .
he came to see me .
the car broke down on the way to the airport .
i was always told to study when i was a child .
i 'm very busy back home .
they want to become rich .
that is why he failed in the exam .
did you cut the paper ?
my father has gone to america .
i wrote him to ask why .
it is said that he is sick .
i looked for a place in which to sleep .
she gave me a doll .
her husband 's health is very precious to her .
sleep is the best medicine for a cold .
put it back on the desk .
i dress lightly all the time .
there is an abundance of pictures in the book .
i 'm not much good at anything , but please be kind to me .
what do you want to be in the future ?
i played catch with my father .
i don 't know anything about japan .
she says she is seeing things .
we saw him walking across the street .
i 've been there a few times .
it 's no use your saying anything .
they were alarmed at the news .
someone beat me to the draw !
she called me in the afternoon .
come and see me tomorrow , won 't you ?
he did the work for himself .
it is not more than ten minutes ' walk from here .
the picture reminds me of my childhood .
he doesn 't have the time to play cards .
it 's already 7 .
i 'm sorry to interrupt you .
thank you for your help .
will it be sunny tomorrow ?
what 's the most beautiful place in the world ?
could i ask you to get a cup of tea for our guest ?
they are going off by plane tomorrow .
i tried to sound out his views .
i am charmed to see you .
i wake up early .
they are hardly likely to come at this late hour .
they require me to work harder .
tears came to my eyes .
buying such an expensive car is out of the question .
i partly agree with you .
none of the students were late for school .
she is economical of her time .
don 't make fun of old people .
he barely passed the examination .
he may have misunderstood you .
i haven 't seen her for ages .
i paid only a trifle for the picture .
don 't hang up !
she 's not the woman she was before she got married .
it is better for you to do it now .
this winter is warm .
she is making progress with her english .
i think it 's getting warmer .
at first , i thought they were sick .
this is very important .
have you heard from her recently ?
he prepared carefully for the meeting .
she made the same mistake as before .
nobody knows why he left the town .
are there any beautiful parks in japan ?
it so happened that they were not there .
she hates speaking in public .
i 've heard that song before .
please don 't bother about me .
yeah , i asked about six times .
i ought to have told her the truth .
i heard john speak to mr brown .
the room was in a perfect order .
i got this book for nothing .
what is in the desk ?
he just barely succeeded .
i made an ass of him .
to say is one thing , and to do is another .
when he saw me , he ran away .
won 't you have some more coffee ?
the student missed class three times in a row .
he took it from beneath his coat .
a lot of construction is going on these days .
the reply came after three days .
swimming is fun for me .
let 's continue with the lesson for today .
it 's a beautiful job .
the game took on among old people .
she can 't ride a bicycle .
please write down your contact address here .
the scientist is famous both at home and abroad .
we got to the station at six .
her dream has come true at last .
i 'd like to fax this to japan .
they have two sons and one daughter .
i am sorry if i disturbed you .
the road ascends to the village .
don 't let children have their own way .
there is an orange on the table .
i can 't stand that noise any longer .
the experience gave him the courage .
i went to kobe by train .
he gave me a promise to come here at five .
i think that she is honest .
he is ready to learn anything from anybody .
you will miss the train .
he didn 't participate in the story .
he was brave enough to go there alone .
his brother studies very hard .
i will keep this experience in mind forever .
could you call a doctor , please ?
my wife is a poor driver .
the old people make a habit of getting up early .
i will wait till you have written the letter .
when does the movie start ?
we were greatly amused by her story .

i had almost finished my work when she came .
he advised us against doing it .
the capital of japan is tokyo .
spring is the best season to visit kyoto .
there was no one about .
the business is in the red .
i 'm older than your brother .
it has too many disadvantages .
people used to travel on foot .
i didn 't meet any of my friends .
i had a fine old time .
the boy could not so much as write his own name .
tom said he was ill , which was a lie .
she found pleasure in reading .
he works hard . so he does .
he is just an ordinary person .
i keep my diary every day .
you 'll get lost .
i 'll lend it to you .
he was very fun .
it 's fun to play , too .
above all , be careful about what you eat and drink .
she went inside .
tom is something of a musician .
i 'm glad to see you again .
i remember seeing him once .
he dare not go alone .
each child was given a present .
they furnished the library with many books .
he made a careless mistake , as is often the case with him .
all systems are go .
he 's only shamming .
she had no one to turn to .
he makes it a habit to keep good hours .
i am short of money .
i want to see you before you go .
it is no use arguing with him .
no one believed me at first .

my father and my brother work in this factory .
he is very clever for a boy of ten .
how tall is he ?
the house stands among trees .
seeing me , she was embarrassed .
she demanded one above the necessity .
the sun is so distant from the earth .
i managed to get there in time .
my brother is a first-year student .
i think i 'll take the test this time .
i am annoyed by his carelessness .
the success of her novel made her rich .
mind your own business !
is there a bank near here ?
did you inform your teacher of this ?
i wish i were a bird .
he isn 't cruel to animals .
he was a wonderful man , that uncle of yours .
truth is time 's daughter .
she will fail eventually .
are you free this evening ?

you could count to ten when you were two .
he did the way he was told .
you 'll be a good player soon .
i cannot choose but hear .

it 's very difficult to put things in order .
what will you be doing at this time tomorrow ?
she revealed her secret to us .
this machine does not run well .
he listened to the music with his eyes closed .
they acted on the information .
he is certain to win the game .

the summer vacation begins in july .
i felt it my duty to do so .

i live with my parents .
tom does anything but study .
i see a flower on the desk .
the time will come when your dream will come true .
it is time to go to bed .
what time does the curtain fall ?
i as well as my brother am to blame .

that 's a pretty dress you have on .
judging from this .
however often i phone i can 't get through .
i am getting a cold .
we live in the suburbs .
i passed a boy in the street .
his help is indispensable to us .
it wasn 't until yesterday that i heard the news .
they are in the same class .
he was very happy .
he lives some where about the park .
i was not studying then .
he did nothing but complain about his job .
i feel much better today .
it 's time to go to school .
when am i to contact you ?
you must take care of your dog .
i 'm just going to run down to the bank .
he was otherwise than i thought .
my wife took good care of this dog .
i 'd like to go with you , but as it is i can 't .
he came out of the room with his eyes shining .
would you mind not smoking ?
i met her by accident at the bus stop .
his sister makes too much of fashion .
let me take you home .
ken is as tall as bill .
she asked the same question of everyone in turn .
why do american parents praise their children ?
he asked a question about it .
so , when is it convenient for you ?
the plan has been agreed to in advance .
i never felt at ease in my father 's company .
next time phone ahead .
there are a lot of new buildings here now .
it may rain tomorrow .
we have a lot of very fine days in october .
i must pay a visit to the doctor .
what train you are going to take ?
an error was made .
we enjoyed watching the tv .
he is sick .
the song caught on with the public .
he said that with dignity .
may i ask a couple of questions ?
i made him carry the suitcase .
she boasts that she 's good at cooking .
we have two ears .
the team will go ahead with the plan soon .
both my parents are at home now .
i remember writing to her .
he got a bad reputation .
he is close with his money .
keep in touch .
i love you !
i am playing the guitar now .
he is three years senior to me .
he had the nerve to say that .
the name of the man i met yesterday is mr hill .
i decided to come to japan last year .
you could be right , i suppose .
cats are very clean animals .
that 's not what i heard .
you got yourself a nice guy .
we arrived at the hotel an hour ago .
be sure and call me tonight .
his voice carries very well .
when will you get through with work ?
no one shall dictate to me .
if i am a fool , you are another .
was this somebody else 's idea ?
unlike her mother , she is tall .
oh , how kind you are !
it is said that his mother is gravely ill .
in fact , i am happy .
he seems to have missed the point .
that dog made for me .
it must be done more carefully .
i 'm glad i 've finally caught you .
i met him on my way from school .
my parents have just arrived at the station .
i think that everybody knows .
would you mind if i turned the tv on ?
what 's your name and flight number ?
you may go or stay at will .
the pain was such that i was not able to sleep .
i was moved to tears .
i collected this proposal .
i telephoned her at once .
it stopped snowing an hour ago .
she would often come late for school .
ask her when she will come back .
i took him up on his offer .
when are you going to europe ?
english is difficult to learn .
have you finished ?
we shall leave tomorrow , weather permitting .
jim has learned to like japanese dishes .
this winter has been mild .
what is missing ?
everybody is waiting for you .
you should take advantage of this opportunity .
i wish he were here now .
she dressed up for the party .
this water is good to drink .
we had better call the doctor .
i can 't buy a book this expensive .
he is an early riser .
under such circumstances , we can not succeed .
what he said is by no means true .
you should always keep your car in good order .
this screwdriver is too small to be any use .
he is waiting for a telephone call .
his family are early risers .
what kind of places would you like to see ?
ten years have passed since he died .
i don 't like this .
it 's necessary for you to go .
it 's too late , anyhow .
you 're a friend of tom 's , eh ?
this book is especially difficult to read .
i repeated the word several times for her .
he is far above me in skiing .
how dare you speak to me like that ?
let 's break up the party .
they dashed water into my face .
i am disappointed at the news .
can i see you tonight ?
i cannot take less .
i went to the hospital to see my mother .
the chemistry is right for us .
you will have your own way .
i have no words to thank you .
i 'll call you at noon .
he is bound to pass the entrance examination .
she was a young girl about your age .
he may have missed the train .
i would like to be your pen pal .
our school is near the station .
the war didn 't break out by accident .
he is used to eating in a rush .
i am going to study english this afternoon .
my boss turned down his proposal .
tom was sitting in the front of the bus .
she got married when she was twenty-five .
we have a little time before the next train .
it is windy today .
seldom does he get angry .
he was very tired .
the wind is blowing hard .
take good care of what you eat and drink every day .
he seems to have been rich .
she gradually began to understand .
you are to blame for the failure .
he is not a teacher but a doctor .
the people of london are very proud of this bridge .
i didn 't have a good time last night .
she is not so much a singer as an actress .
you must clear the table .
he doesn 't like the heat of the summer .
i 've studied english for five years .
i stand for freedom of speech for everyone .
what 's that bird ?
he looks a good deal better today .
they went to the park the next morning .
how can you say that ?
he was too old to swim .
i helped her into a gown .
i feel fresh after a walk .
he was always as good as his word .
if you take this medicine , you will feel better .
they looked at each other .
there is nothing that does not decay .
are there any letters for me ?
don 't give up english .
is there anything that i should not eat ?
it came on to rain toward evening .
she didn 't take many photos .
do you think he made that mistake on purpose ?
sorry , that 's a typo .
he was overjoyed to find out that his son had succeeded .
he moved to new york , where he looked for a job .
why can 't you come ?
she called her children into the room .
you 've grown so tall .
we cannot thank you too much for your help .
i think it 's worth asking .
i decided not to do such a foolish thing .
don 't make fun of other people .
she helped her mother of her own accord .
it seems that his sister is a good cook .
what heading does this book come under ?
i will be able to see you next year .
oedipus thought for a long while .
rod lives across the street from john .
i don 't think she is happy .
he walked on for some time .
we have been good friends for a long time .
there appears to have been an accident .
start reading where you left off .
tom knocked him down .
her mother was busy cooking the dinner .
what hours is it open ?
make the most of your college life .
i may die tomorrow .
it 's cold today so button your coat .
it is difficult for me to solve that problem .
i 'm sure he is a man of ability .
do it again !
what 's currently hot ?
we met him on the way there .
the place i live in is very good for your health .
it was cruel of him to say such things to her .
she went to new york , leaving her family behind .
i can 't make her out .
your paper contains too many mistakes .
who were you talking with ?
please call in a doctor .
it is time you told her the truth .
you didn 't need to hurry .
the smiths are all good people .
his secret life came to light at last .
i congratulate you on your success .
please help yourself to the cake .
both of my sisters are married .
i bought a pair of shoes .
this hat is too big for you .
your efforts resulted in the success .
you 'd better not go today .
he will be a good teacher .
get me the scissors , please .
i will say something about it .
this room is comfortable .
please give me your permanent address .
the question is when to start .
i found him a job .
one day he was walking along the street .
my watch keeps very good time .
would you come here a moment ?
seven is said to be a lucky number .
please shake hands .
have you been in contact with him recently ?
he asked an awkward question .
the old man asked me the time .
are you sleeping , tom ?
he eats a lot .
it is nothing to me .
this book is easy enough for a five-year-old child to read .
he made good as an entertainer .
i don 't know when my mother will come back .
there is a radio on the table .
can someone take our picture ?
school will open on monday .
i went to the hotel by cab .
i sat between tom and john .
keep away from the dog .
she said that she had met him three months before .
she is a wonderful wife .

i think it impossible for us to beat him .

she has been studying english since the age of ten .
it 's your turn to drive .
he was curious to know her secret .
my children really like animals .

close your eyes and go to sleep .
her hair became gray with the years .
it 's that time again ! wake up .
it doesn 't pay to talk with him .
where would you like to go next ?
when i understood him i thought better of him .
my brother helped me with my homework .
i don 't know the reason why she isn 't coming .
i could swim well when i was a boy .
call an ambulance .
my father goes to work by bike .
kyoto is visited by many tourists .
you don 't need to go unless you want to .
i lived in new york last year .
i usually play tennis .
people above 18 may drive .
i hope that she 'll get well soon .
i was born in kyoto in 1980 .
she has a charming face .
it is i who am head of this family .
you don 't have to beat your way .

you can see from his chin that takes after his father .
he caught sight of a ship in the distance .
come and see me right now .
he stood up .
he was kind enough to show me the way .
can you explain how this machine works ?
when you 're in a hurry , it 's easy to make a mistake .
you always insist that you are in the right .
the headlight doesn 't work .
i didn 't request you to do that .
i know nothing but this .
call up tom right away .
if she were here now , i would tell her the truth .
he said , '' let 's take a walk along the river . ''
she is a woman of great beauty .
we found a poor little cat in the yard .
the train was delayed on account of snow .

suddenly , the captain left the ship .
i will miss you all .
