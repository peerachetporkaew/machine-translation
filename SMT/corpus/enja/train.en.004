i found her in tears in her room .
i asked her a difficult question .

this is the camera with which he took the picture .
i remember mailing the letter .
how long have they been here ?
even though they were poor , they were happy .
he is a man of his word .
he came to see me .
the car broke down on the way to the airport .
i was always told to study when i was a child .
i 'm very busy back home .
they want to become rich .
that is why he failed in the exam .
did you cut the paper ?
my father has gone to america .
i wrote him to ask why .
it is said that he is sick .
i looked for a place in which to sleep .
she gave me a doll .
her husband 's health is very precious to her .
sleep is the best medicine for a cold .
put it back on the desk .
i dress lightly all the time .
there is an abundance of pictures in the book .
i 'm not much good at anything , but please be kind to me .
what do you want to be in the future ?
i played catch with my father .
i don 't know anything about japan .

they require me to work harder .
tears came to my eyes .
buying such an expensive car is out of the question .
i partly agree with you .
none of the students were late for school .
she is economical of her time .
don 't make fun of old people .
he barely passed the examination .
he may have misunderstood you .
i haven 't seen her for ages .

i heard john speak to mr brown .
the room was in a perfect order .
i got this book for nothing .

my father and my brother work in this factory .
he is very clever for a boy of ten .
how tall is he ?
the house stands among trees .
seeing me , she was embarrassed .
she demanded one above the necessity .
the sun is so distant from the earth .
i managed to get there in time .
my brother is a first-year student .
i think i 'll take the test this time .
i am annoyed by his carelessness .
the success of her novel made her rich .
mind your own business !

he was a wonderful man , that uncle of yours .
truth is time 's daughter .

you could count to ten when you were two .
he did the way he was told .
you 'll be a good player soon .
i cannot choose but hear .
i 'll call you up again in an hour .
the phone call was a trick to get him out of the house .
this is worth one million yen .
his letter made her angry .
you may sit wherever you like .
i 'm running out of laughter .
i climbed the mountain last summer .
please speak as clearly as you can .

one of them is a spy .
i 'll drop if i don 't sit down .
i 'm free now .
when shall i call on you this afternoon ?
take care not to catch a cold .
he tried to knock at the door .
it 's a typo . sorry .
it is characteristic of him to do such a thing .
it 's very difficult to put things in order .
what will you be doing at this time tomorrow ?
she revealed her secret to us .
this machine does not run well .
he listened to the music with his eyes closed .
they acted on the information .
he is certain to win the game .

there is not a drop of water left .
the summer vacation begins in july .
i felt it my duty to do so .

tom does anything but study .
i see a flower on the desk .
the time will come when your dream will come true .
it is time to go to bed .

that 's a pretty dress you have on .
judging from this .
however often i phone i can 't get through .
i am getting a cold .
we live in the suburbs .
i passed a boy in the street .
his help is indispensable to us .
it wasn 't until yesterday that i heard the news .
they are in the same class .
he was very happy .
he lives some where about the park .
i was not studying then .
he did nothing but complain about his job .
i feel much better today .
it 's time to go to school .
when am i to contact you ?
you must take care of your dog .
i 'm just going to run down to the bank .
he was otherwise than i thought .
my wife took good care of this dog .
i 'd like to go with you , but as it is i can 't .
he came out of the room with his eyes shining .
would you mind not smoking ?
i met her by accident at the bus stop .
his sister makes too much of fashion .
let me take you home .
ken is as tall as bill .
she asked the same question of everyone in turn .
why do american parents praise their children ?
he asked a question about it .
so , when is it convenient for you ?
the plan has been agreed to in advance .
i never felt at ease in my father 's company .
next time phone ahead .
there are a lot of new buildings here now .
it may rain tomorrow .
we have a lot of very fine days in october .
i must pay a visit to the doctor .
what train you are going to take ?
an error was made .
we enjoyed watching the tv .
he is sick .
the song caught on with the public .
he said that with dignity .
may i ask a couple of questions ?
i made him carry the suitcase .
she boasts that she 's good at cooking .
we have two ears .
the team will go ahead with the plan soon .
both my parents are at home now .
i remember writing to her .
he got a bad reputation .
he is close with his money .
keep in touch .
i love you !
i am playing the guitar now .
he is three years senior to me .
he had the nerve to say that .
the name of the man i met yesterday is mr hill .
i decided to come to japan last year .
you could be right , i suppose .
cats are very clean animals .
that 's not what i heard .
you got yourself a nice guy .
we arrived at the hotel an hour ago .
be sure and call me tonight .
his voice carries very well .
when will you get through with work ?
no one shall dictate to me .
if i am a fool , you are another .
was this somebody else 's idea ?
unlike her mother , she is tall .
oh , how kind you are !
it is said that his mother is gravely ill .
in fact , i am happy .
he seems to have missed the point .
that dog made for me .
it must be done more carefully .
i 'm glad i 've finally caught you .
i met him on my way from school .
my parents have just arrived at the station .
i think that everybody knows .
would you mind if i turned the tv on ?
what 's your name and flight number ?
you may go or stay at will .
the pain was such that i was not able to sleep .
i was moved to tears .
i collected this proposal .
i telephoned her at once .
it stopped snowing an hour ago .
she would often come late for school .
ask her when she will come back .
i took him up on his offer .
when are you going to europe ?
english is difficult to learn .
have you finished ?
we shall leave tomorrow , weather permitting .
jim has learned to like japanese dishes .
this winter has been mild .
what is missing ?
everybody is waiting for you .
you should take advantage of this opportunity .
i wish he were here now .
she dressed up for the party .
this water is good to drink .
we had better call the doctor .
i can 't buy a book this expensive .
he is an early riser .
under such circumstances , we can not succeed .
what he said is by no means true .
you should always keep your car in good order .
this screwdriver is too small to be any use .
he is waiting for a telephone call .
his family are early risers .
what kind of places would you like to see ?
ten years have passed since he died .
i don 't like this .
it 's necessary for you to go .
it 's too late , anyhow .
you 're a friend of tom 's , eh ?
this book is especially difficult to read .
i repeated the word several times for her .
he is far above me in skiing .
how dare you speak to me like that ?
let 's break up the party .
they dashed water into my face .
i am disappointed at the news .
can i see you tonight ?
i cannot take less .
i went to the hospital to see my mother .
the chemistry is right for us .
you will have your own way .
i have no words to thank you .
i 'll call you at noon .
he is bound to pass the entrance examination .
she was a young girl about your age .
he may have missed the train .
i would like to be your pen pal .
our school is near the station .
the war didn 't break out by accident .
he is used to eating in a rush .
i am going to study english this afternoon .
my boss turned down his proposal .
tom was sitting in the front of the bus .
she got married when she was twenty-five .
we have a little time before the next train .
it is windy today .
seldom does he get angry .
he was very tired .
the wind is blowing hard .
take good care of what you eat and drink every day .
he seems to have been rich .
she gradually began to understand .
you are to blame for the failure .
he is not a teacher but a doctor .
the people of london are very proud of this bridge .
i didn 't have a good time last night .
she is not so much a singer as an actress .
you must clear the table .
he doesn 't like the heat of the summer .
i 've studied english for five years .
i stand for freedom of speech for everyone .
what 's that bird ?
he looks a good deal better today .
they went to the park the next morning .
how can you say that ?
he was too old to swim .
i helped her into a gown .
i feel fresh after a walk .
he was always as good as his word .
if you take this medicine , you will feel better .
they looked at each other .
there is nothing that does not decay .
are there any letters for me ?
don 't give up english .
is there anything that i should not eat ?
it came on to rain toward evening .
she didn 't take many photos .
do you think he made that mistake on purpose ?
sorry , that 's a typo .
he was overjoyed to find out that his son had succeeded .
he moved to new york , where he looked for a job .
why can 't you come ?
she called her children into the room .
you 've grown so tall .
we cannot thank you too much for your help .
i think it 's worth asking .
i decided not to do such a foolish thing .
don 't make fun of other people .
she helped her mother of her own accord .
it seems that his sister is a good cook .
what heading does this book come under ?
i will be able to see you next year .
oedipus thought for a long while .
rod lives across the street from john .
i don 't think she is happy .
he walked on for some time .
we have been good friends for a long time .
there appears to have been an accident .
start reading where you left off .
tom knocked him down .
her mother was busy cooking the dinner .
what hours is it open ?
make the most of your college life .
i may die tomorrow .
it 's cold today so button your coat .
it is difficult for me to solve that problem .
i 'm sure he is a man of ability .
do it again !
what 's currently hot ?
we met him on the way there .
the place i live in is very good for your health .
it was cruel of him to say such things to her .
she went to new york , leaving her family behind .
i can 't make her out .
your paper contains too many mistakes .
who were you talking with ?
please call in a doctor .
it is time you told her the truth .
you didn 't need to hurry .
the smiths are all good people .
his secret life came to light at last .
i congratulate you on your success .
please help yourself to the cake .
both of my sisters are married .
i bought a pair of shoes .
this hat is too big for you .
your efforts resulted in the success .
you 'd better not go today .
he will be a good teacher .
get me the scissors , please .
i will say something about it .
this room is comfortable .
please give me your permanent address .
the question is when to start .
i found him a job .
one day he was walking along the street .
my watch keeps very good time .
would you come here a moment ?
seven is said to be a lucky number .
please shake hands .
have you been in contact with him recently ?
he asked an awkward question .
the old man asked me the time .
are you sleeping , tom ?
he eats a lot .
it is nothing to me .
this book is easy enough for a five-year-old child to read .
he made good as an entertainer .
i don 't know when my mother will come back .
there is a radio on the table .
can someone take our picture ?
school will open on monday .
i went to the hotel by cab .
i sat between tom and john .
keep away from the dog .
she said that she had met him three months before .
she is a wonderful wife .
i am in the habit of taking a walk every day .
we started it again right after dinner .
is there a post office around here ?
sorry . i missed the train .
don 't be so greedy .
i 'm looking for you .
i hope your brother is better .
i have the same trouble as you had .
i was badly in need of his help at that time .
i think it impossible for us to beat him .
i agree with you to some extent .
she has been studying english since the age of ten .
it 's your turn to drive .
he was curious to know her secret .
my children really like animals .
what was stolen ?
the man wrote down the name for fear he should forget it .
you had better make a clean breast of everything .
close your eyes and go to sleep .
her hair became gray with the years .
it 's that time again ! wake up .
it doesn 't pay to talk with him .
where would you like to go next ?
when i understood him i thought better of him .
my brother helped me with my homework .
i don 't know the reason why she isn 't coming .
i could swim well when i was a boy .
call an ambulance .
my father goes to work by bike .
kyoto is visited by many tourists .
you don 't need to go unless you want to .
i lived in new york last year .
i usually play tennis .
people above 18 may drive .
i hope that she 'll get well soon .
i was born in kyoto in 1980 .
she has a charming face .
it is i who am head of this family .
you don 't have to beat your way .
the trouble is that he thinks only of himself .
i 'm really concerned about your future .
she had a happy childhood .
