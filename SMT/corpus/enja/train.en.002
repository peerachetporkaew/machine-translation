that he will fail is certain .
i arrived in london .
will you kindly show me the way to his house ?
the sun is about to set .
there is no telling what will happen next .
spring is coming soon .
tell her not to get near the dog .
it 's news to me .
above all , be kind to old people .
why are your eyes so big ?
he could not send his son to school .
i 'm afraid he cannot come .
he and i share a room .
english is the world 's language .
on sunday , we would get up early go fishing .
nobody could give the correct answer .
she has done us many kindnesses .
please speak as slowly as possible .
in a sense , it is true .
i doubt his story .
it would be better for you to speak to him .
what is in the garden ?
when did he arrive here ?
she turned down the radio .
he had little , if anything , to say .
get on a horse .
how do you feel today ?
it is said that he will go abroad .
how many days does it usually take to get there ?
i 'm very sorry about the mistake .
who is that gentleman ?
it looks like he will win .
we communicate with each other by telephone every day .
you are not old enough to go swimming by yourself .
the story was true .
she was encouraged by the news .
they as well as you are ordinary people .
he was angry with his son .
one more person will be joining us later .
come and see me once in a while .
what is the problem ?
i want to buy a more expensive watch .
come home before dark .
the problem was very difficult .
after you 've had some tea , carry on practising .
i have a lot of things to tell you .
they looked up to john as their leader .
we went to a restaurant .
he delivered a speech .
my hair is as long as jane 's .
is he going to help us ?
has the fever gone down ?
his son troubled him most .
the party was not altogether pleasant .
he always wears heavy clothes .
i am going to have my watch repaired by john .
her beauty stood out in our class .
keep the room in good order .
he is the only one of my friends that is talented .
we leave for karuizawa this afternoon .
come on , don 't be silly .
where 's convenient for you ?
he crossed me up .
when he heard it , he saw red .
i have made up my mind to work harder .
i 'll try her out as a secretary .
ellen does not speak english .
you 're new , huh ?
i found the book which i had lost the day before .
is this your first visit to this town ?
he loves trains .
tom doesn 't like cheese .
could you let him out ?
it 's already eleven . it 's high time you were in bed .
he is hard to please .
are they american ?
the picture was taken from the air .
we had plenty of snow last year .
he will come in a moment .
when will you next visit ?
i am tall .
this is the camera which i bought yesterday .
it was shining in the sky .
i am interested in history .
her hands are full taking care of the baby .
this is all i know .
i will be seeing her again one of these days .
i want to execute the plan by all means .
that 's very naughty of you .
we are human .
i always have a look at the newspaper before breakfast .
i would often take a walk before breakfast .
will you lend me your bicycle ?
here are a few coppers .
the teacher told me study harder .
do you have anything cheaper ?
i came to the realization too late to make a difference .
he 's got not only a motorbike but also a car .
she has gone out .
you should have come home before .
it is preferable that he gets there by tomorrow .
this car is running less smoothly than it used to .
get out your wallet .
i have been busy writing a short story .
will you go to america next month ?
he reached for the book .
they are all irritable .
i will not go the length of saying such things .
my brother will often sit up all night .
i got to the station this morning .
in fact , the man got angry .
he told me that he wanted to leave the company .
the more we have , the more we want .
the cup broke .
be quiet , all of you .
it is very cold here .
i was waiting for a taxi .
i like to travel alone .
my father gave up smoking .
she kept me waiting for a long time .
i got cold , so i put on my coat .
we hardly had enough cake for every boy .
she soon adjusted herself to the new school .
i take a bath every morning in summer .
please phone me when you have settled down .
all of us got into the car .
they are always complaining .
everybody likes him .
i could not but laugh at his joke .
let 's drink to absent friends .
the child got angry and struck at his mother .
his speech was too short .
it was very lucky for me that i saw him .
it must be hard for you .
nothing was to be seen but water .
he was kind enough to lend me money .
several of them are opposed to the bill .
i don 't believe such a story .
can i please have something hot to drink ?
your method is different from mine .
the weather outlook for tomorrow is not good .
i was tired of watching tv .
the time is yet to come .
i looked at his face carefully .
the weather will remain cold for several days .
we arrived here at six yesterday evening .
no , no ! that 's not right .
to tell the truth , she is my niece .
you had better talk as clearly as you can .
i don 't like her .
he need not get up so early .
my brother was expert in handwork .
her beauty was beyond description .
speak louder , please .
we still have plenty of time .
he is having lunch .
i want to go home .
you must observe those rules .
now she is gradually getting well .
his novel had a great vogue for a long time .
let 's leave the problem until tomorrow .
if i knew it , i would tell you .
i like sachiko better .
do you have a cheaper room ?
she does not want to be dependent on her parents .
for my part , i have no objection to the proposal .
it is very difficult for you to do this work .
the operation is quite free from danger .
his opinion is different from mine .
do you know why they stopped talking ?
they were swimming .
every means has not been tried .
i was impressed by his music .
i will do my best to put such an idea out of your head .
the storm blew up .
not all children like apples .
i have to take some money out of the bank .
do come if you can !
here is my bicycle .
they were waiting for the gate to open .
it is high time you were in bed .
put your room in order .
she ate her dinner .
what would you like to be called ?
i got it , ok ?
she is right in her opinions .
did you call me up last night ?
he is without parallel .
that child is a headache .
she got the ticket for nothing .
she is very fond of dogs .
this is the largest dictionary there is in this library .
he is opposed to the new plan .
could you send this letter to japan ?
i don 't think she cares very much .
you better believe it .
i must get my watch repaired .
he was listening to music in his room .
i 'm sure he will carry out his promise .
don 't always take sides with him .
please be certain to answer the phone .
did you enjoy yourself at the party ?
what a man you are !
she wrote down what he said .
i want to travel with you .
he promised to sell .
it is not so hot today as yesterday .
i would like to address two questions .
here we are finally at the airport .
he is used to getting up early .
she lived up to our expectations .
i was surprised to hear her voice in the next room .
i will write to him at once .
you cannot have your own way in everything .
look before you leap .
she will be here this evening .
i feel like another beer .
tell him where he should go .
my father was busy .
i don 't feel like doing my math homework now .
put away your books and notebooks .
which bag is yours ?
there are several peoples in the country .
you ought to see a dentist .
it isn 't hard to do .
do you have any french wine ?
his brother passed away last month .
i 'll pick you up at your home at five .
the fault is on the part of my father .
i can speak english .
watch your step .
his behavior is sometimes strange .
may i take your order ?
he has dozens of english books .
i can understand french to a certain extent .
the browns were all kind to me .
it is stupid of you to lend him your money .
this bridge is three times as long as that .
the rich are not always happy .
what 's on the air this evening ?
that is not quite what i wanted .
i saw the man enter the room .
it has resulted in nothing .
if it rains , the game will be put off .
you must not keep in touch with him .
you shall not for nothing as long as i live .
is anything the matter with him ?
please forgive me .
life is at best very short .
please take care not to break this vase .
we made him go .
its value had trebled .
i met her by chance .
the pain was terrible .
shall we stop in at a coffee shop ?
one day in july , we went to the sea .
the event came about like this .
they say that old house is haunted .
milk does not keep long on a hot day .
he is concerned about his parent 's health .
take it easy .
it goes without saying that good health is more important than wealth .
i am too ashamed to do it .
do not read such a book .
i have lost my key .
i had just finished my homework when he visited me .
why don 't you try a different tack ?
it looks as if you 're right .
i 'm afraid it will rain tomorrow .
there was a fire near the house today .
he never fails to call his mother on her birthday .
i don 't care what will become of me .
as is often the case with him , he was late again .
i 'm tired .
it is useless to talk to him .
would you like some more tea ?
but for air , nothing could live .
we learn english at school .
i 'd like to get a refund .
that 's not a bad idea .
we can pay 100 dollars at most .
we took part in the discussion .
he is quite frank with me about everything .
school begins in april .
a heavy snow kept us from going to school .
this is what i can do for you .
we parted at the station at three .
that is the exactly the same idea as i have .
how is the weather today ?
please make yourself at home here .
he is a good carpenter .
we had no choice but to go there .
i would like to speak english fluently .
i hear it 's buried under all that snow .
i am running short of money .
i can 't stand being laughed at in front of others .
i take it for granted that you will join .
can i make an outside call by this phone ?
to begin with , we have no money now .
he is like a brother to me .
i want to be with him all the way .
the store is across the street .
how long has it been snowing ?
thank you very much for your hospitality today .
i ought to have made a hotel reservation earlier .
she was at a loss for words .
when is your birthday ?
he put terms on his problem .
she agreed to my idea .
let me in , please .
my sister has a very good brain .
we have had a long spell of hot weather .
he was not anxious for fame .
the plane is on the way from tokyo to italy .
you will write a letter .
i heard the boys singing .
a baby is incapable of taking care of itself .
do you believe that there is life after death ?
the boy is over there .
the door remained closed before her .
i 'm very slow at making up my mind .
i bought this yesterday .
it will be fine tomorrow .
make one 's hair stand on end .
you say you changed schools .
the garden is in front of the house .
i have a friend waiting for me in the lobby .
many beautiful flowers bloom in spring .
i 'd like to give you a piece of advice .
life is like a journey .
his father doesn 't play golf .
i go to the library two or three times a week .
i 'm not a bit tired .
he is apparently responsible for it .
the sun has gone down .
it looks appetizing .
i got a letter from her today .
he has distorted my speech .
i made friends with him .
you may as well keep it a secret .
don 't phone her now .
how was your summer vacation ?
please show me another one .
most girls are kind .
she turned down our proposal .
that is not my idea of him .
were you reading a book at that time ?
we will begin the meeting when bob comes .
she is a teacher .
that was why he entered the university .
she came home just now .
a number of japanese people travel abroad every summer .
it was sultry last night .
what are you doing so hard ?
the doctor advised my father to stop smoking .
he lived here for a time .
i hope you will get well soon .
please let me in .
ouch ! my foot !
someone seems to be calling me .
you may use my new car .
we saw her enter the park .
you are right to a certain extent .
i approve of your plan .
he has been loved by all .
she burst into tears to hear the news .
how high is that mountain ?
can i take pictures here ?
did your parents approve of your marriage ?
leave that box where it is .
this watch is expensive .
i don 't think any of those horses is going to win .
she looked him in the face .
don 't leave the door open .
this is an interesting book .
what do you want ?
let 's talk quietly in order not to wake the baby .
she is as beautiful as ever .
you will be allowed to go out soon .
i play the piano for amusement .
he doesn 't know how to play the guitar .
we cannot tell which is better .
he is humble about his opinion .
he is a man of understanding .
she must have been sick .
i have a few books .
we sat on the bench in the park .
karen is not angry with me .
we saw a strange object in the sky .
he brought back his child in his car .
nothing is as pleasant as a walk in the morning .
i 'll take the yellow one .
i am off duty tomorrow .
we were forced to work hard .
did you enjoy yourself ?
she wept over her son 's death .
do you know him at all ?
don 't get off the train till it stops .
is this the town where mika was born ?
i would rather you hadn 't told him the truth .
i bet it will rain tomorrow .
is this canadian money ?
the boy who spoke to me was a new student .
they are looking into the problem .
can you tell me how to get to the station ?
i am afraid of dogs .
this is what i want .
he died leaving his beloved children behind .
i found it easy to solve the problem .
i don 't think it will rain this afternoon .
this watch is my father 's .
this is my bag .
he is not so old as my brother .
easy come , easy go .
his success encouraged me very much .
he could make his way in life .
he came out with an angry face .
we expect that he 'll help us .
i was too happy to sleep .
she continued studying all her life .
a short walk will bring you to the station .
i saw something strange in the sky .
i live in an apartment .
i watched tv at six last night .
i like listening to music .
it 's for a friend of mine .
john kept his head above water .
this is the best camera in the store .
this is the house where he was brought up .
his brother is a very capable doctor .
i have almost no money with me .
where is the nearest station ?
please make yourself at home .
she will be late for dinner .
have you decided to go to australia ?
it was his silence which made her angry .
return the money to him at once .
he looked at me and barked .
i quite agree with you .
the news of the air accident left me uneasy .
she was kind enough to help us .
you can go wherever you want to go .
will that idea come off ?
don 't put off answering the letter .
i 'll do it with pleasure .
i 'm going to stay with my uncle in kyoto .
he went to nara .
my birthday is in november .
she gave him her name and telephone number .
mr smith is pleased at his son 's success .
or that was the idea .
keep away from bad company .
i saw her enter the room .
he died one year ago .
let 's take a walk .
her house stands back from the road .
some girls were playing tennis .
a man on horseback came along the path .
excuse me , is this seat taken ?
what 's the cause ?
may i help you clear the table ?
keep your head down .
this plane is his .
at night we can see more stars there than in tokyo .
you may as well go home now .
i am quite ignorant of the plan .
that 's a good idea !
she was scared to death of her husband .
it is going to rain this afternoon .
the dog is called ' spot ' by the family .
i feel for you deeply .
do you like japanese food ?
the police are making every effort to look into the case .
you may depend on him to help you .
she was kind enough to show me the way .
do you ever date her ?
she stood up and walked to the window .
it 's the dry here .
we went to the park to play baseball .
and so the man come in .
i see him once in a while .
he has brown eyes .
don 't spoil the children .
the train was overturned .
do not say such foolish things .
you did wrong in trusting too much in your ability .
i think it 's strange that she was absent from school .
where did you go yesterday ?
he 's sexy .
we 're short of something .
i made an appointment to see the doctor at four o 'clock .
every man in his way .
they were playing tennis .
he kept us waiting for more than an hour .
he fell into a rage .
that problem was accepted .
he took it for granted that she was happy .
i cannot thank you enough .
she is learning the piano .
he would do anything for gain .
it 's a common mistake .
if only i could speak french .
it is impossible to account for tastes .
declare one 's love .
i exchanged some yen for dollars at the bank .
he promised me to come .
i have enjoyed talking to you .
he kept at the job all day .
i should have starved to death for want of food .
how hot it is today !
you have another chance even if you fail this time .
we all enjoyed the film .
it is strange that he should say so .
the old man sat surrounded by the children .
don 't be so self-assertive .
you 're going to a movie ?
the talk dragged on till three o 'clock .
let him alone . he 'll soon come around by himself .
he married ann .
i was writing her a love letter .
tom married an older girl .
where 's the dining car ?
don 't think i 'm joking .
though it was cold , he didn 't light the fire .
did you enjoy yourself at the party ?
will you have some more cake ?
i know how to drive a car .
i am afraid he won 't come .
no doubt he will pass the examination .
that japanese word has no equivalent in english .
i missed the train by only a few minutes .
you had better do it right now .
my car is under repair .
he is always on time for an appointment .
he is always expressionless .
i 'm going to go through with it in spite of her opposition .
if you disguise yourself , they won 't be able to tell .
so for we have enjoyed our journey very much .
father has never gotten sick in his life .
can you weigh this , please ?
she was intelligent as well as beautiful .
he has another son .
i go to any party i am invited to .
you had better help your father .
that 's nothing but a figure of speech .
they don 't like me .
my book is on your desk .
he crossed over to england .
our school has ten classes .
we live on the earth .
i want you to be an einstein .
i never felt at ease in my father 's company .
i 've known him ever since he was a child .
he had some sympathy for the child .
i 'll call him first thing in the morning .
she closed her ears to what he was saying .
how pretty she is .
tom has many talents .
not too well .
how tall he is !
she will make a good wife .
he told me that he was going to italy .
could you put your seat back up a little ?
no , sit down .
my legs failed me then .
the snow kept us from going out .
she is just started for your house .
let 's do lunch !
we are to go on a hike tomorrow .
she phoned her husband to come immediately .
could you take me to the grand hotel ?
i think it certain that he went to tokyo .
i have something to tell you .
he will not come today .
i got my son to cook supper .
what were you doing then ?
it is under the chair .
look at the picture .
we were at school together .
i will advise you on the matter .
you can 't go wrong if you are advised by me .
i can 't recollect how to do it .
the tv doesn 't work .
don 't ever do that kind of thing again .
this is the car i spoke of the other day .
she cleaned the room .
the door is open now .
he ran five miles .
children should keep away from the danger .
he has a deep affection for his son .
we don 't know when this world came into being .
i am running short of memory .
he said he wanted to be a scientist .
i 'm not in so great hurry .
don 't keep the tv on !
never be late for school again .
she had the kindness to buy a ticket for me .
i 'm far from happy about this situation .
how far is it from here to the hotel ?
she went out without saying a word .
you don 't have to stand over me .
he is hard to deal with .
she deposited the box on the table .
to our surprise , she revived at once .
this is the very dictionary i 've been looking for .
i helped him walk across the street .
it is said that her father was killed in a traffic accident .
london was a city built for the horse .
she married to the kind of man you would expect her to pick .
she 's older than tom .
i have never been to kyushu .
may i speak to you a minute ?
we saw a mountain in the distance .
ken has a white dog .
it is damp and cold today , isn 't it ?
they are the only students who study chinese .
i can take care of yours truly .
he is an honest man .
he asked his wife if she was coming with him .
why don 't you come along with us to the party ?
i went to the zoo .
go down this street three blocks .
i 'm going by the post office .
tell me the right time , please .
keep the change .
it is no use studying when you are sleepy .
i don 't see him .
mother has gone to the market .
all of you are diligent .
now i am a teacher , i think otherwise .
i find it hard to get up early on cold mornings .
is kumi playing tennis ?
my daughter has reached a marriageable age .
she is busy with the care of her children .
i make too many mistakes .
this airport is easily accessible by bus .
he turned his experience to good account .
i thought him very honest .
i will write to her tomorrow .
i am pleased with the result .
he finally reached the hotel .
he will be free tomorrow .
he is quite a gentleman .
this book is mine .
he will have his own way in everything .
before long , she will be a good teacher .
it isn 't worth repairing this car .
his idea is good for nothing .
this dress comes in three sizes .
there comes our teacher . he is walking very slowly .
my father is still ill in bed .
he doesn 't get along with anybody in the office .
you should take advantage of this opportunity .
do you have any vacancies ?
you should leave out these two lines .
i sometimes cook dinner .
this is how i made the machine .
i 'd like you to go there .
i 'm talking on the phone .
the old man told the children an amusing story .
i may have hurt his feelings .
this is a good book for children to read .
all the students are present .
we visited our old school .
to understand someone is to love someone .
a good many people were there .
it takes time to relax .
they say we 're going to get high winds .
it is pochi 's food .
they have not yet heard of it .
you should study harder .
father built me a new house .
that 's where the problem is .
he 's depressed about the result .
they got a warm reception .
i do not love him any longer .
i am writing a letter .
i will present myself at the meeting .
clean your teeth !
the word has several meanings .
will we have more snow this year than last year i wonder .
check your answers with his .
they were hindered in their study .
i 'm setting off tonight .
where is this ?
your remarks were rather out of place .
i am anxious for your success .
i expected him to offer some help .
they 're in aisle two .
he writes letters to his mother .
i am not liked by this dog .
this book is very small .
he is ashamed to ask questions .
bring your work to my room .
he sometimes ate out with his family .
may the new year bring you happiness !
i want to have a part-time job , too .
you 'd better set off at once .
how about going for a drive ?
you can 't hope to have your own way in everything .
have you ever seen it hail ?
sit down , please .
the table takes up a lot of space in this room .
run , or else you 'll be late .
i gave the poor boy what little money i had with me .
this beautiful house is so expensive that we can 't buy it .
they easily fall back on his company .
she is far from a fool .
they described the girl as being small .
have a nice summer vacation .
my father will come home at seven .
we are going to have an examination in english tomorrow .
i know nothing to the contrary .
these shoes need polishing .
i will work to the best of my ability .
i 'm going to have a heavy day .
the heavy rain kept us from going out .
that will do us a fat lot of good .
no sooner had he done it than he began reading .
they have just arrived .
spring has come around .
the teacher said to me , '' get out ! ''
the post office is the brown building .
how is your cold ?
he went to london via paris .
i love you !
every man cannot be happy .
at first , i couldn 't play the guitar .
have you finished doing your homework yet ?
there is every promise of success .
he tries hard .
you 'll soon get accustomed to this cold weather .
the door was broken open .
will you go to the party instead of me ?
my father caught three fish yesterday .
he 's nothing .
i have been going steady with her for three years
how do you like living on your own ?
he was born in a small town in italy .
will he ever come back ?
don 't play baseball here .
we got into his car and went to the sea .
he went to the airport in a hurry .
she gave a poor explanation for being late .
i assume that this idea will work well .
i wonder if anything happened to him .
this is the reason why i came here .
must i repaint the wall ?
he disclosed my secret .
never have i dreamed of marrying you .
the man who lives next door to me is a doctor .
are you bringing your camera ?
he set us by the ears .
i am looking forward very much to the school excursion .
tom pretended not to know the answer .
i 'll give him your message when he comes .
i can 't get over how different the weather is here .
when shall we get together next ?
i was poor at english .
i insist on your being present .
this is insoluble in water .
such a man cannot be relied upon .
she went out just now .
they looked at each other .
how fine it is today .
she shuddered with cold .
who does he look like ?
much still remains to be done .
he was born in nagasaki .
she is anything but a singer .
there was a large audience at yesterday 's concert .
i have been to kyoto twice .
he played tennis yesterday .
it will not be long before we can take a trip to the moon .
i acknowledge my mistake .
i want to have a telephone installed .
do you have any cds ?
this is the reason why i came late .
where is the lost and found ?
let 's meet on sunday .
he worked hard in order to pass the examination .
she made it clear that she didn 't like him .
will you hold this seat for me ?
we saw a white ship far away .
after all , it 's sure to fail .
this room has fine view of the mountain .
he hit the mark .
i visited fukuoka ten years ago .
do you have a book written in english ?
do you like sports ?
he 's famous around the world .
i agreed to the proposal .
i think that this work is tiring .
this is a book about england .
he has been ill in bed for a week .
there is no tv in my room .
i would like to draw .
where are you headed for ?
jim must be hospitalized at once .
the girl running over there is my sister .
we came in view of the sea .
i am busy today .
they were frozen to death .
can i talk to someone who speaks japanese ?
let 's begin at the last line but one .
the moon is very beautiful this evening .
there 's nothing to make such a fuss about .
may i use your car , dad ?
they are all the same .
he is of japanese ancestry .
how far is it from here to the station ?
in summer , it is very hot here .
her son meant everything to her .
my mother is on a diet .
push the door open .
the mistake cost him his head .
the more people have , the more they want .
it 's about time you stopped watching television .
i doubt your good sense .
he should have finished his work by now .
