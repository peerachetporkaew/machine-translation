that town looked prosperous .
i 'll bring the book back to you tomorrow .

the key is on the desk .
i meant to have written to you .
this will do for the time being .
this is the only thing that was left .
i am not more intelligent than him .
though it was raining , she went out .
i often heard her sing that song .
he is no friend of mine .
the moon was mirrored in the lake .
he took pains to write this song .
let 's discuss the problem .
the explanation is by no means satisfactory .

this is just what i wanted .

'' what time is it ? '' he wondered .
i 'll get in touch with you as soon as i arrive .

she is more pretty than beautiful .
it makes my head swim to hear you say that .

how are the kids ?
his explanation doesn 't make sense at all .
they have lost a lot .
i 'm afraid i have to go now .
i will watch tv as soon as i get through my job .
we went swimming in the river .

i doubt if bob will come on time .
this bus will take you to the airport .
he is the very man i want .
i can 't be around smoke .

i 'd like to keep the car there .
there are few men who don 't know that .
not a word did he speak .

i 'm sorry to have disturbed you .
may i ask a question ?
i couldn 't bring myself to tell her the truth .
i bought a picasso .
her story brought back our happy childhood .
i missed the point of the joke .
thousands of people were there .
she was heard playing the violin .
we do need your advice .
do you know what has become of him ?
what is his business ?
these days many old people live by themselves .

i live in a two story house .
i will be back by nine .
the soldier gave his name .
there is a garden in front of the house .
we 'd better go back a little .
it will clear up by and by .
there 's nothing good on television .
he would not follow my advice .
did you hear the news on the radio ?
he was grateful for your help .
this car is my father 's .
tom asked his father if he could go to the cinema .
i 'll do the rest of the work another time .
in an emergency he had nothing to fall back upon .
it 's a pity that you can 't come .
to master english is hard .
it goes without saying that experience is a good teacher .
everyone was more or less interested in the arts .
children usually pick up foreign languages very quickly .
i don 't know for certain when he will arrive .
it would be better if you took a rest here .
she read a cookbook last night .
let me have your suggestion as to what i am to say .
he sat in front of me .
it was my turn to clean the room .
i always keep my deadlines .
it took me three hours to finish my homework .
i think he is angry .
his advice was very helpful .
in spring the days get longer .
i have heard nothing from him yet .
let 's break off for half an hour and have some coffee .
we will make it public .
here we were at tokyo station .
you 're still young .
don 't change your mind so often .
with a little more patience , you could succeed .
there was much food in the house .
as far as i know , this is the best one .
she cared for her sick mother .
she was in a hurry to see the new baby .
the work is easy enough for me to finish in a couple of hours .
i 'm afraid i 've offended you .
we lack nothing .
when i was a child , i could sleep anywhere .
he had dark brown hair .
when are they going to put the book on the market ?
i 'm convinced that my daughter will pass the exam .
there is a garden at the back of my house .
the dog wants to go outside .
why haven 't you been showing up to work lately ?
that 's not my concern .
i can 't make her out .
there is no returning to our younger days .
it is nice and warm today .
there are not any books under the desk .
we met her brother at the shop by chance .
i have nothing special to say .
i want to see you .
somebody took away my bag .
the hut was set on fire .
this is the nth time i 've told you to be careful .
i got her a wrist watch .
don 't be too hard on me please .
i decided to become a doctor .
would you give me a discount ?
come to that , i 'd like to do some shopping too .
i can see a clear blue sky and feel so good .
he is not strong as before .
the prize went to him .
she fell in love with her friend 's brother .
he nodded to her to come along .
he may well be proud of his father .
it 's in plain sight .
when he saw the police officer , he ran away .
he stopped working due to health concerns .
how much did you pay for the dress ?
the news turned out true in a week .
i will not dwell any longer upon this subject .
you 're a wonderful guy .
please tell john that i called .
let me know what you 're up to .
it was raining today . what 'll it be like tomorrow ?
it would have been better if you had left it unsaid .
she is widely known .
i , for my part , have nothing more to say .
i was not a little disappointed .
what do you mean ?
when did you meet her ?
we decided by vote .
the flowers withered for want of water .
this is japan as americans see it .
i am going to work out the problem by myself .
got to go now .
that shop is a hamburger shop .
it was an exciting game .
her car collided with a bus from behind .
give medicine to the patient right away .
is that true ?
some people are difficult to please .
she had nothing to do yesterday .
the hard work has run him down .
nothing replaced his love .
i can recommend this book to you .
i don 't understand much about it .
what about watching the night game on tv ?
she said that they were good friends of hers .
let 's divide this money between you and me .
he is very kind to me .
when will you leave ?
please call me up tonight at my office .
my uncle has been dead for three years .
she is bad at sports .
i wish we had more time .
she is hostile to me .
he is the last man i want to see .
please answer my question .
i 'll take this one .
don 't hesitate to ask questions .
she demanded to know about it .
he didn 't mean to hurt you .
i am as tall as he .
the baby is still sleeping .
let me help you , if necessary .
she is far from a fool .
that movie is exciting .
i will go out if it is fine tomorrow .
who doesn 't think so ?
you couldn 't solve the problem , could you ?
do you mean you met her ! ?
he is the last person to tell a lie .
it is you who are to blame .
that is not the case .
which do you like better , meat or fish ?
she is wearing a nice dress now .
she was all smiles .
on the rocks , please .
but i can 't understand them very well .
this book gave me a good laugh .
i 'm wrong , am i not ?
summer has come .
i wonder if she will marry him .
she finished her homework in an hour .
he tried to give up smoking but in vain .
the lecture was above me .
there is nothing for it but to obey .
that 's exactly what he said .
it is impossible that she should have killed herself .
i doubt if he will come on time .
he is well spoken of by everybody .
i want you to open the window .
father is now busy writing a letter .
don 't rely too much on others .
there is no knowing what may happen .
this classroom is very large .
i got up at five that morning .
he is the proper person for the job .
she admits knowing the secret .
this house is too narrow to live in .
he is still standing .
he came running into the room .
i have a pain here .
how often a month do you go to the movies ?
you can get it at a bookstore .
my brother has much in common with me .
the boy was absent from school yesterday , because of illness .
she was heard to cry for help .
have you called her yet ?
you can 't take away these books .
mr green is anything but a good teacher .
the weather stayed hot for a few days .
we had a heavy rain last night .
japan today is not what it was even ten years ago .
suddenly , it began to rain .
please don 't compare me with my brother .
i bought a red sports car .
he will pass the coming examination .
it is necessary for you to stop smoking .
the man is all but dead .
happy is he that is happy in his children .
you are a beautiful butterfly .
i moved nearer in order to hear better .
i told him to clear out of the room .
he hurt his hand when he fell .
please remind me to phone him tomorrow .
you have only to come here .
i think it will rain today .
this problem is not so difficult as it seems .
i like a garden tree .
the town has many high buildings .
he was already regretting it .
he comes here every five days .
i got it free .
he was sick in bed all day yesterday .
he would have succeeded .
he doesn 't study as hard as he used to .
i 'm going to get my own way this time .
he made a positive answer .
i got up early , so that i could catch the first train .
i came upon a friend of mine in the bus .
i argued with them about the matter .
i am supposed to go to tokyo next week .
i do not want to reply to his letter .
they were badly in need of water .
it may be that he is not a bad man .
don 't tell lies .
no , i 'm not sleepy .
my plan was rejected .
they are human .
i read about his death in the paper .
why he did it is beyond my comprehension .
we have had little rain this summer .
a big earthquake occurred in tokyo .
i 'll make you happy .
we will have an english test this afternoon .
a little bird told me .
don 't speak ill of your classmates .
did you have a good sleep ?
i read a lot in my diary yesterday .
we offered him a nice job .
it was impossible for him to take the picture in the dark .
i am going to play soccer tomorrow .
he doesn 't believe me at all .
my mother is always complaining about me .
were you at home last night ?
when do you start for sado ?
are you going by bus or car ?
i often fell , but i never gave up .
the class divided on this question .
she leaves for new york next sunday .
he will be back in a few days .
i can 't abide such a person .
if you try at all , you should try your best .
the child is father of the man .
perhaps it will rain in the afternoon .
they are both good students .
i feel that i don 't really belong here .
long , long ago , there lived an old man in a village .
the store might be closed already .
are you subject to colds ?
i cannot agree with you .

he worked hard only to fail again .
it rained three days on end .
she always buys expensive clothes .

she cannot have forgotten my address .
i have two cars .
want to hear something funny ?
can we talk ?
either you or i am right .
she is two years older than you .
i was in new york for a few days .
the old man has enough money .
i hope that he will help me .
i feel just fine .
she must be ill in bed .
it is necessary that everybody observe these rules .
our experiment went wrong last week .
i am prepared to put up with it for the time being .

i hope your plan will work out .
the wind is blowing very hard .
it fell short of my expectation .
the sun having set , they left off their work .
i think most people are better off now than they used to be .

they will agree on that .
i acknowledge it to be true .

it has some bearing on this problem .
has he gone already ?
you can trust him to keep his word .

you must work very hard on duty .
it is strange that he should say such a thing .
the food isn 't very good here .
you must keep quiet for a while .
which do you recommend ?
we ought to look the world straight in the face .
i found him to be a good workman .
we had to put off the meeting .

the man ran away .
he made up his mind quickly .
i don 't have much time .
my father will travel abroad next year .
i wish to be a doctor .
the house stands on the hill .
he crossed the river in a small boat .
in that case , i 'll change my mind .
if he had been a little more careful , he would have succeeded .
i 've told you over and over again not to do that .
i 'll give him a pen .
i was wearing my best clothes .

i don 't mind waiting for a while .
jack speaks english .
tom cut classes again .
i carried on my work .
look at the book on the desk .
as a child , he went to paris three times .
he has a hungry look .
i wonder if he loves me .
i can 't agree with you on this matter .
we kept quiet in the room .

this is just what i wanted .

i 'll find someone to fill in for you .

as for me , i have no objection .
i met her in a coffee shop near the station .
let 's get together on sunday .
she got over the shock of her father 's death .
he is a very careful driver .
there were few children in the room .
nobody can exist without food .
can you go with us ?

a man 's worth has nothing to do with his appearance .
the phone was out of order again .
she got the children ready for a walk .
this is by far the best .
i went hiking .
today , i bought ten books in all .
i told him that he was wrong .

i dare say you are tired .
this singer is made too much of .
you should stay in bed .

he showed his mother around the city .
do you have enough information to go on ?
the machine is now in operation .
give me a ring tomorrow .
it may rain at any moment .
she has to go shopping in the afternoon .
all you have to do is to wait for her reply .
he came at three in the afternoon .
this play has ended .
how did you do in your exam ?
bring in lunch for the children .
it is blowing very hard .
i left my key in my room .
he set off to paris .
please let me take your picture .
you had better not make a noise here .
i would like to go with you .
i felt sorry for the boy .
his son is in college now .
what was it that caused you to change your mind ?
i said that i didn 't go shopping with her .
he won her affection .
he must go there tomorrow .
i miss you very much .
we go to school every day except sunday .
i am to blame for it .
this is what i 've long wanted .
one acquires bad habits very easily .
i have to go now .
she is known to everyone .
i don 't know for certain .
my father disapproved of my going to the concert .
this probably means war .
let me see that .

he glanced at his watch .
i don 't shampoo my hair in the morning .

a fire broke out last night .
will there ever be a better ?
i sometimes see him on tv .
i can 't understand the psychology of such a man .
i always walk to school .
i failed to go to his birthday party .
he must be crazy to say such a thing .
jim can be said to be a man of parts .
i wonder which way to go .
the company was transferred to a new man .
you 'll be in time for the train if you start at once .
may i have your name , please ?
this is japan .
which is older , this book or that one ?
i wish i could break the habit of smoking .
theirs is an old family .
i have to study .
i 'm going to stay here for several days .
i cannot excuse her .
why didn 't you bring your wife to the party ?
do you think her story is false ?

in days gone by , things were different .
he stayed behind in view of possible danger .
either you or he is wrong .
the wind has died down .
i 've been to the seaside by car .
