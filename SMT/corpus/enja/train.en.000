what is the principle reason for going to school ?
let 's begin with that question .
i like to adorn her room with flowers .
a young child has a small vocabulary .
i 'll miss you .

your answer does not make sense .
we need another person to play cards .
don 't touch the flowers .
so much for today 's work .

does she work in this city ?
his speech continued for three hours .
he opened the door .
she came down to breakfast at eight .

and spent that day with him .
she came an hour beyond the appointed time .
you know nothing of the world .
his father calls him tom .
do you want to go to dinner today ?

popular or not , it is right .
there is little furniture in my house .
i have a great deal to do today .
he is employed in a bank .
he arrived two days previously .
he worked hard in order to get the prize .
you can 't wring any more money from me .
they started one after another .

let 's be going now .
i 'm no better at cooking than my mother .
his clothes didn 't match his age .
traveling by sea is a lot of fun .

the flowers brightened the room .
i like to draw pictures .

i am not sure but she may come .
this is much the better of the two .
whose books are those ?
he likes to walk about in the park .
he has a large number of books .
he is more gentle than kind .
can you see fish swimming in the water ?
please tell me your name .
they are all in arms .
i am paid 10 dollars an hour .
that has no bearing on our plan .
the thing is , i don 't really want to .
in times like this , there 's nothing like a hair of the dog .
he is much taller than i am .
there was a fire near the train station last night .
my son is now as tall as i am .
even children can read this book .
he didn 't give me anything to eat .
i feel very feverish .
he abstained from smoking .
i nearly made a mistake .
let 's reserve that for another occasion .
please reserve this table for us .
at last he found out the truth .
i stayed at a hotel on a hill in that town .
i don 't know for certain when he will come .
i want to live in comfort .
i 'm counting on you .
he turned to his friends for help .
what would you do , if you had a million dollars ?
she is my dream girl .
i think it important to tell him the facts .
since it was raining , we stayed at home .
i can 't see what you mean .
you 're a reporter .
the child was hot with fever .
we had to call off the game because of rain .

with all her faults , i still like her .
he lost the sight of one eye in a traffic accident .
i enjoyed swimming .
i suggested going for a walk .
take this medicine when you have a cold .
i have no particular reason to do so .
he came running .
is it hard to speak english ?
i like coffee very much .
he is very close with his money .
suddenly , a good idea occurred to me .
won 't you come to my house next sunday ?
old mr smith is saving as much money as he can .
how about the taste ?
please tell me what happened to him .
suffice it to say that , after all , this won 't do .
most boys like computer games .
you may take either half of the cake .
i often run into her at the supermarket .
up against the wall !
i found it difficult to understand what he was saying .
i have heard the story .
she regarded the story as a joke .
we had a very good time last night .
i looked for the key .
i made this kennel by myself .
he made her his wife .
we 'll go along with your suggestion .
my friend has a large family .

what would you do , if you were in my place ?
bring me today 's paper .
we are in for rain .
his efforts come to nothing .
i am interested in mountain climbing .
he is not very fast at making friends .
i think that they will be late .
i was able to catch the last train .
my brother goes to college in kobe .
you should always be careful in your speech .
that 's right , isn 't it ?
i think his life is in danger .
it is yet to be seen whether this plan will succeed or not .
homework must be done by tomorrow .
he held out his hand .
we looked , but saw nothing .
have him wait a moment .
he is in want of money .
they were on board the same airplane .
in the first place , we must be careful about what we eat and drink .
the dress comes to my knees .
why are you crying ?
he became the company president when he was thirty .
my older brother is a teacher .
i 'm twice your age .
she turned pale at the news .
the game will be called off if it rains tomorrow .
i met my classmate .
can you stand on your hands ?
i would like you to make tea for me .
she keeps her diary in english .
having walked for sometime , we came to the lake .
i 'm sorry , but he is out now .
i went there to meet him .
i wish there was more variety in my work .
the doctor has saved my life .
if you have any questions , please let me know .
this is an interesting story .
the dog looked into the water .
to change the subject .
don 't worry about the work .
what he says is true to some extent .
you are quite in the wrong .
has father come home yet ?
you don 't need to go in such a hurry .
i have met her before .
so you 've got to be a believer .
are you going to learn english ?
she is an earnest student .
no , i did it on my own account .
please choose between this one and that one .
he knows whatever .
in brief , i need money . please lend it to me !
he walked two miles in half an hour .
i will study abroad when i have finished school .
we should wait here for the moment .
i found him at his books .
he is a good loser .
don 't give up if you fail .
the rain kept us from going out .
what animal is it ?
she began to talk to the dog .
we have a lot of work to do .
i arrived just in time for the plane .
what subjects are you taking at school ?
we are dependent on each other .
i 'm not too clear about that point .
she came out with some strange tunings .
let 's make believe we have one million yen hand .
i could not make myself heard in the noisy class .
by god , i 'll finish this homework .
i haven 't seen him lately .
i don 't like him because he loses his temper easily .
he is master of this house .
he is a gentleman .
may i speak with you ?
the game exhausted me .
quiet down , please .
i did not watch tv but studied english last night .
let 's get started right away .
he was running and calling for help .
this is the most difficult book i have ever read .
the meeting broke up at eight .
i was late because of heavy traffic .
i paid him a visit yesterday .
it is really quite a good story .
every house had a garden .
i 'm freezing .
mary prided herself on her beauty .
we arrived on the morning of the seventh .
i don 't know what to do .
she is good-natured .
where is my seat ?
such a thing can 't happen in japan .
she could not refrain from tears .
why don 't i try to do something about the garden ?
for example , do you like english ?
the garden was filled with flowers .
i do not read his novels .
i don 't want any sandwiches .
how well she is singing !
his opinion is quite different from ours .
it seems that we have lost our way .
she came across the street .
the fact is that he slept late that morning .
this hotel does not take dogs .
there is no denying the fact .
i bought a good camera .
tonight i 've got to do get ready for tomorrow .
he has always devoted himself to music .
we could not open the box anyhow .
ten to one it 'll clear up in an hour or so .
this pair of shoes doesn 't fit me .
all the buses are full .
he is far from being a gentleman .
i 'm afraid she may have the mumps .
could you ring up these books for me ?
don 't be so reserved .

may he live long !
we went down to the valley where the village is .
i 'm tired of watching television .
he is spoken ill of by his students .
would you mind repeating the question ?
i 'm exhausted .
his words hurt her feelings .
newspapers did not report that news .
what makes him hated ?
i am very pleased with my job .
my father is in the hospital now .
the conference is to be held in tokyo the day after tomorrow .

he was happily married .
i 'd like something to eat .
we will go but you won 't .
some day my dream will come true .
the sun is just setting .
we were in london last winter .
when did america become independent of england ?
could you send up a band-aid and some medicine ?
mother told me to behave myself .
i want you to play the guitar for me .
he was hard to please .
i was given a nice watch by my uncle .
i want your opinion .
that isn 't the case in japan .
the reason which he gave is hard to understand .
summer is the season when women look most beautiful .
when i grow up , i want to be an english teacher .
just keep on walking .
he always speaks to me when he meets me on the street .
it is , as it were , a life and death problem .
seeing me , the baby began to cry .
let 's sing a song .
the path is broken .
i want my mother to get well soon .
he did me a good turn .
this coat is warm .
he is a very nice student .
this book is easy enough for me to read .
if you are busy , i will help you .
we will leave in an hour .
i can make nothing of what he says .
i suggested that john be called .
she soon came to believe him .
good morning , everyone .
what pretty flowers !
what a tall boy tony is !
she lost her new watch .
do you know the reason ?
he is not always late .
children should keep away from the river . it 's dangerous .
he will come tomorrow .
how did such a thing come about ?
what do you say to seeing a doctor ?
i thought as much .
she lost to him in tennis .
don 't wake up the sleeping child .
i can 't get rid of this cold .
how did you reply ?
i am now independent of my father .
i have been there scores of times .
i have kids to take care of .
she is his real mother .
the poor girl was on the point of death .
it 's about time you got here !
suppose we change the subject .
he will soon be past playing with toys .
i arrived there too early .
you can depend on his help .
since it was raining , i took a taxi .
his statement really cut me .
hanako is set on going to paris .
my mother knows how to make cakes .
we got involved in a traffic accident .
the job is half done .
he can swim very fast .
he told me to do it .
i adhered to my decision .
she gave away all her dresses .

i was not a good mother .
the girl is friendly to me .
me , too .
i cannot thank you enough .
i believed every word he said .
i ran across an old friend in the street .
the matter is of great importance .

a big tree fell in the storm .
don 't watch tv .
let 's go !
the war lasted two years .
i 'm busy with my homework .
do get up , it 's very late .
the rain prevented me from going .
i wonder where he is now .
how lucky we are !
the paper says that a typhoon is on its way .
he has been speculating on his future .
she had an itch to see her child .
we must abide by the rules of the game .
it being sunday , we have no classes today .
don 't find fault with other people .
i play tennis every sunday .
it is a fact that i don 't know her name .
i would rather stay at home than go out today .
i could make nothing of what he said .
we chartered a bus .
we must be going now .
when it rains , the buses are late more often than not .
i have a slight cold .
i couldn 't get to sleep .
they need daily care .
come round to see me at eight tonight .

tell me when it came about .
your family must be very nice .
young children soon pick up words they hear .
i was made to go there .
jane went to the bank to take out some money .

my sister asked me to lend her the dictionary .
we are students .
what has become of him since then ?
you had better not keep company with him .
she may well be proud of her only son .
open the window . it 's baking hot in here .
even a child can understand it .
you are all too quick .
the house was destroyed by fire .
can you give me a ride to the station ?
no one was to be seen in the street .
i forgot to turn off the tv before going to bed .
my house was robbed while i was away .
quiet him down , will you ?
every student has free access to the library .
a lot of children gathered in the garden .
we gave a ball last week .
i thought that he was honest .
tell me whose hat this is .
am i making myself clear ?
our school is across the river .
would you please call him back later ?
she goes to market every day .
i lost the watch father had given me .
i 'm glad to hear of your success .
let a sleeping dog lie .
how he eats !
you should go and see for yourself .
he 's living from hand to mouth .
i prefer going out to staying home .
he ran out into traffic .
you must be kidding !
do you have a table for five ?
i know you can make it better .
that boy 's hair is black .
he should get to your house in an hour .
know who you are .
he seems to be worried about something .
won 't you go for a walk ?
would you like to wait in the bar ?
i would walk along the river .
please don 't forget to see him tomorrow .
she yelled at the children to be quiet .
i would quit before i would do that job in this company .
we enjoy talking .
she became a doctor .
start this moment .
i met a friend of mine at the airport .
i feel it now .
please help yourself .
how do you like japan ?
only if it 's not too much trouble .
i could not have done it .
dead men tell no tales .
above all , i want to see him again .
it hardly ever rains there .
they say that he was ambitious when young .
we may as well walk as wait for the next bus .
in short , he was too honest .
you should try to cut your way .
i made it myself .
so the captain took care of him .
are you listening to him ?
do you have to go to market , too ?
hurry up , or you 'll miss the bus .
wash your feet .
do you happen to know his name ?
this song reminds me of the good old days .
she lives in the village .
they did not wish to go any farther .
i 'll bring it to you tomorrow .

he called me up almost every day .
i 'm studying the american drama .
take a seat over against her .

what time does the last tokyo train leave ?
he was looked up to by all his friends .
because it rained , i didn 't go .
it is no more than ten minutes ' walk from here .

set the clock right . it 's ten minutes fast .
we understand the necessity of studying .
what do you conclude from that ?
i 'm much better today than yesterday .
he turned away the question .
come and help us .
you must be the temporary we asked for .
oh , you 're going home tonight !
he has decided not to go to the meeting .
why don 't you rest a bit ?
put the gun on the table .
who made this plan ?
he was at work till late at night .

ten to one he will succeed .
my father used to go to work by bus .
i can 't sleep at night .

a piano is expensive , but a car is more expensive .
i will be happy to attend your party .
i will meet you off the train tomorrow .
would you care for a drink ?
thank you very much for your hospitality .
he accepted my idea .
can you find the time to play with our daughter ?
all right . i 'll come as soon as possible .
i could not come up to his expectations .
he goes abroad every year .
my toothache returned in a few hours .
i don 't work on sunday .
i tried everything to keep him alive .
this river is very dangerous to swim in .
let 's go back before it begins to rain .
he was not aware of the danger .

i was constrained to tell a lie .
he looked unfriendly at first .
i was revived by a glass of water .
the airplane soon went out of sight .
i like taking a walk in the forest .
no living thing could live without air .
which way will you take ?
don 't run risks .
the job of a driver is not as easy as it looks .
after ten minutes ' walk we came to the museum .
those men are of a generation .
where 've you been keeping yourself ?
hurry up , and you will be in time .
kate went to a party to see her friend .
he never pays much attention to what his teacher says .
ken has been looking for you .
i like mahjong .
i mentioned your name to him .
he looked out of the window .
this book has a lot of pictures .
he walked up and down the room .
i don 't need any bit of your charity .
i 'd like the same style as this one .
i discussed the matter with her .
she left the baby crying .
speak louder so everyone can hear you .
it 's stormy .
will you make room for me ?
he was wet all over .
after i locked all the doors , i went to bed .
don 't leave it open .
that 's a bad day for me .
i remember my mother when i see this .
we were moved to tears .
she was kind enough to help me .
it is her that i want to meet .
i had no notion that you were coming .
thank you for the shipment .
she said she would be back right away .
start by doing the books .
is he anything of a scholar ?
what do you say to waiting five more minutes ?
lots of famous people come here .
she mentioned my name in her book .
it 's awfully cold today .
i feel like taking a walk now .

i don 't mind getting up at six .
i am to meet him at five at the station .
while staying in tokyo , i came to know her .
i took her for an american .
she married him for the sake of his family name .
he lives near here .
do you mean that you have already decided on this plan ?
he is popular with the people at large .
they confronted each other .
could you put it in plain language ?
it soon began to rain very hard .
you boob ! i should not have asked you .
i 'm sorry for your not having come with us .
we had a lot of fun at the skating .
the exhibition is well worth a visit .
may i take a shower in the morning ?
i 'm very sleepy today , too .
it 's not just you , i am also to blame .
why are you crying ?
have you finished ?
even a child knows right from wrong .
let me go in place of him .
i dreamt i was a bird .
there is no telling when the war will end .
as i was tired , i took a rest .
the children were playing at keeping house .
mother prepared us lunch .

the class were divided in their opinion .
let me have a look at it .
the french president is to visit japan next month .

i have no information she is coming .
put this japanese into english .
such being the case , he is unable to pay .
are they writing a letter ?
how long will you stay here ?
to all appearance it is true .
this report isn 't to the point .
he has a big future in baseball .
we are watching tv .
we are all anxious about your health .
he nodded to me .
a number of books were stolen .
mother went to town to get some bread .
there wasn 't a single book in the room .
i feel well today .

once i lived in osaka .
you should always tell the truth .
our train was an hour late because of the heavy snow .
i don 't know who he is .
she pondered the question for a while .
are you ready to order now ?
you should be kind to others .
he must have seen it .
in fact , i was there .
now i must go about my work .
you must consider it before you answer .
we carried out that plan .
not a word did she say to me .
i live about an hour from the station .
i am to take over my father 's business .
she cannot have done such a thing .
i hope you 'll be happy forever .

you must not get away from reality .
they gave us very little trouble .
this door will not open .
he can speak french well .
we had better begin to prepare for the test .
we have plenty of time .
have a cup of tea , won 't you ?
do you like the piano ?
we had a wonderful holiday .
just take it easy .
i can 't make out what she said .
he has something to do with the matter .
the game was called off on account of the rain .
i can make nothing of it .
she pointed out my mistake .
i 'll wait here until my medicine is ready .
i owe what i am today to my father .

you will succeed in the end .
she ended up getting married to him .

i have heard nothing from him since then .
say with one 's own lips .
you are right to a certain extent .
peace will come to us in time .
he seems to know the secret .
it is up to you to decide what to do .
the woman who came here yesterday is miss yamada .
we used to meet on our way to school .
i like soccer best .

that is the way things went for a while .
they didn 't tell me so .
let the problem alone .
he was playing with a toy .
can i borrow your radio ?
he sees everything in terms of money .
he passed among the crowd .
how does this bear on my future ?
i was not aware of his presence .
we work from nine to five .
it is impossible to put the plan into practice .
words failed me .
the best is best cheap .
there 's no soap .
she took to her new teacher .
i 'd like to have dinner with you .
i 'm very sorry i came home so late .
i walked along the main street .
the girl went to sleep .
she cannot have been ill .

i went to the airport to meet my father .
he went out for a walk with his dog .
slow down or you 're going to work yourself sick .
they worked hard day and night .
he was no longer dependent on his parents .
the little boy is afraid of the dark .
it was nice and cool there .
he was bewildered on that day .
when the bus came , she got on .
you are a good cook .
i turned to him for advice .
this will bring you to grief .
do you have a vision of your future ?
he is ashamed to ask questions .
they seem to make nothing of the problem .
either of them is honest .
this dictionary is by far the best .
alice has had a cold since last sunday .
shall we take this outside ?
i heard someone scream .
would you like to come in for an interview next week ?

it doesn 't matter whether he agrees or not .
he commanded us to work hard .
i didn 't believe him at first .

that means sure death !
she looks like a teacher .
who planned that trip ?
work hard so that you can succeed .

she should have arrived home by now .
ken makes it a rule to get up early .
how 's it going with your family ?
you are all that is dear to me in the world .
you should have accepted his advice .
we agreed to his suggestions .
my wife is a good manager .
his account of the accident accords with yours .
please take good care of yourself .

he seems to have been ill .
she is happy .
